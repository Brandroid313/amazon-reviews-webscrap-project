# amazon-reviews-webscrap-project
A juypter notebook project that scrapped and performed sentiment analysis on some Amazon reviews.
The notebook walks you through the code and files. The webscraping code has been commented out at first as 
some additional steps are needed in order to get it to workk. Those steps are given in the begininng of the notebook. 
The other code is to take the reviews that were scrapped ( and stored as csv files ) and perform some custom sentmient analysis.
