5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",wonderful tech,"I'm really sad that this Inspire 2 is catching so much grief in the reviews here, but what I believe it boils down to is most people only leave bad reviews. If someone is happy with something they usually won't take the time to come on an write about it unless it is beyond brilliant. I wont go so far as to say this fitbit is that, but it is a wonderful gadget and personally I find no truths in what many here are complaining about. Firstly I would like to start with, if comparing to the HR and making a decision between the two, definitely go with the newer model. It does more; like the 24/7 heart rate monitor which is really great to keep an eye on, the active zones and a great battery life. So far I've gone 4 days with no charge and only gotten to 65%, that's incredible to me. Not to mention this new model includes a free year of premium which has a lot of great stuff in it like fitness guides and mediation exercises.When I was making the decision I read pros and cons comparisons and ultimately it was these and the sluggish touch screen on the HR that led me to choose the Inspire 2. I'm glad I did, I have zero regrets. And for some reason this is cheaper right now than the older model! (Edit: it looks like that was  pre holiday sale and it's more expensive now which does make sense, it is better) It's functioning flawlessly. It was a great price, is very easy to use, and really is a good little motivator.I love the gentle alarms, the relax exercises, and the little reminders to drink water and exercise. The sleep tracking is really fascinating and a personal goal of mine to work on, this is a major help to me in that regard. I love that it is swim safe as well, since I'm big on swimming.I have pretty small wrists, and while it sits off of it a bit, it's not overly bulky and is light, and by no means bothersome.Also the recommendation for wearing it is slightly loose, not snug, and I find the best position for it is just above the ulna.As far as people having trouble with it getting stuck on one screen and always showing their weight or constantly buzzing with alerts? That is 100% user error. I will say with confidence if you take your time to sit down and just read through and explore the app with patience, it is all very user friendly. These screens can be backed out of, changed, and alarms/ reminders set or cancelled.There was also a review that mentioned there's no way to view the HR on the main screen, and you have to swipe through 5 times or so to get to it. While that is one way, there is also the quick function on the home screen just below the clock, tapping this will cycle through which to display (HR, calories, active zones, miles, and steps) so you can have your HR and time visible anytime.My two biggest ""issues"" with it which are very minor, would be the band, which tends to irritate the skin slightly with constant wear. Cleaning, switching wrists or bands is a simple solution.The other one is that the steps aren't incredibly accurate, they give a rough idea, but I tend to halve mine based off of my walking routes that I know. This is a broad guess on my part, steps matter least to me but it's probably closer to 75% accurate.Keeping that and the relatively low price in mind, I think this is a wonderful all over health tracker and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality tracker at a reasonable price and healthier lifestyle. It is a small piece of plastic that I find quite incredible at what it is capable of doing for being so tiny, and am amazed at all of the extras in this!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Charge 2 HR vs. Inspire 2,"My four year old Charge 2 HR battery was getting weak so I decide to buy a new Inspire 2 and I’m glad I did.First of all, it does everything and more than what my Charge 2 HR did for me, which was quite a lot.  Without taking advantage of the free Premium offer, all the data presentation I enjoyed with the older Charge 2 HR is included in Inspire 2.  Plus improvements in looks, screen brightness, a much longer battery life and a link to my phone GPS for improved tracking of my long walks.The negative reviews I’ve read revolve mostly around the irritation of the vibration notifications.  To preempt those problems I immediately turned off almost all of the notifications.  Do you really need your watch tell you your phone is ringing?  Or you can’t remember that you’ve been sitting in your chair for the last hour?The setup was super easy.  From your current app account, add a device and make sure it synchs to your new Inspire 2 so all of the data stored in your old Fitbit ports into you new device.  I just let the battery run out on my old Fitbit and will soon delete it from my account.For only $99 this is a great device."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great Purchase for My Health!,"I am very happy with this Fitbit. I was a little worried about a lot of the top reviews here, but am happy to report that so far I have not had any of the described issues. After doing some research I purchased this item solely for the pedometer/activity reminders. I've ended up appreciating a lot more of the features. Here is my breakdown after 3 continuous days of wear:Comfort: I have a small wrist, and wear it about 1/2 inch up from where my wrist bends. I have not had any issues with buzzing. The only thing that has taken some getting used to is wearing it while sleeping.Accuracy: I have done several experiments with counting my steps and steps recorded. The most I counted myself was 150, and the watch was within 10 steps of my count. It has never been more than 10 steps off. This has been a great tool for my primary focus of consistent daily movement.Features: I thought I wouldn't enjoy the other features offered with this, but I have to say the premium membership (comes with 1 year) has been really fun to use. I've been looking at my sleep metrics, paying more attention to my schedule, and have even used their mindfulness exercises.  *It's important to note, that it says the free year premium membership is only for new members, but I had a fitbit in 2015/2016 and I still got automatically upgraded.The watch can auto-recognize 6 different exercises that you customize, and has been good at picking up what I'm doing. I am looking forward to trying out the exercise programs on the premium account too. The app has helped me set goals like a target number of active minutes, days per week that I exercise, and lets me know what target heart rate zones I've spent time in.I appreciate that this can link with my fitness pal. I have noticed occasional bugs with food transferring from mfp to fitbit, but so far it is stuff that is easy to edit. I like that my calorie goals will be more accurate based on my tracked activity.I have not tried the notifications feature and won't. I also have not tried the link to track my activity with my phone's gps. That being said, my battery life is at 80% for 3 days of wear which puts me on track for the approximate 10 day battery.Update: I finally had to charge it after 13 days. I did stop sleeping with it on after day 7. I kept pushing it up too high on my arm while I slept. Others may not have this issue. Still very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love my Fitbit Inspire!!!,"I was worried about all the reviews that mentioned endless vibrations, but so far no issues. I didnt realize I had my notifications like texts and calls turned off, so the only time it vibrated in the first few days of wearing it was when I hit 10k steps. I'd suggest reading up on how to set the correct settings for your goals and notifications  before saying all it does is vibrate. Using the app to learn how to use the fitbit is also a breeze. It's stylish and comfortable, even to wear to sleep. It definitely motivates me to get moving and the app is great for tracking your progress and customization. Was easy to set up and sync with my phone as well. Overall, I'm impressed and very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Perfect Upgrade!,"I decided to get this after my Alta HR finally died. I was happy with the functionality of the Alta, but this model has greatly improved my motivation when it comes to getting my workouts and steps in. I also think it looks nicer and I don't mind the slightly larger size. I don't have any issues with the touch buttons on the sides, probably because my wrists are so small and I wear my Fitbit further away from my wrist. My Alta would sometimes slide around so I'd have to move it higher up when I worked out, but this Fitbit stays put and I never have to adjust the band. I really couldn't be happier with my purchase especially with the Black Friday deal!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","Looks good, charge lasts long","Bought to replace a Fitbit Alta which had a battery that lasted less than 8 hours and had to be recharged continually. So far 5 days and the charge is still 71%.  Has better functionality than the Alta and is easy to read. The aftermarket band, a metal magnetic clasp band, was easy to install and looks great. Reliable so far."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great activity and sleep tracker! No buzzing!,"I love this fitbit. I almost didn't buy it because some of the reviews mentioning the buzzing and how some features are displayed.I do not experience the excessive buzzing. This must be in the settings and people have asked to be notified about ALL THE THINGS. The only time mine buzzes is when I reach 10,000 steps (it has a little on screen firework display, cute!). I do not have it synced to give phone notifications, I don't want to know when I get emails, texts, calls from my watch... I also don't have any of the movement reminders turned on either. I use a work timer, so I get up after every session with my timer.The clock faces are customizable. You can choose what stats are shown on the watch homescreen. I like the stat heavy watch face (which is what is pictured). I do wish there was one that used the 24 hour clock, but that is my only major complaint.Nowhere is my weight listed on the watch, but there is one section if I scroll through that says how much weight I've lost. The weight info is mostly all in the app.I can't say how accurate it is, but the pedometer is definitely more accurate than my phone's internal one. The GPS can be used through your phone to track walks/runs/biking and I've found it to work quite well.I've had great luck with the sleep tracking. Based on reviews I never put it into sleep mode, and it hasn't missed a night of tracking in the 6 weeks I've had it.It's also been cool to see how my resting heart rate changes as I've become more active in my day to day life.Overall, if you want something to help motivate you to get moving and develop better sleep habits, I think this is a great purchase. My battery usually lasts at least a week and charges pretty quickly. I didn't want a smart watch or to over pay for the simple features I was interested in so the Inspire 2 was perfect for me!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",I really don't know why people are hating on this so hard,"I almost didn't get this because of all the negative reviews. But I really needed motivation to move my body during quarantine, especially since, like many others, I caught the ""Corona-15"" (meaning I gained 15 lbs, for those that didn't catch the joke).I love this thing. It does NOT vibrate for me every time I move my wrist up. It just quietly displays the time.I used to use the FitBit app on my iPhone, but I hated dragging my phone around with me every time I went on a walk. Sometimes I wanted to disconnect from my phone.Getting this device has already been a game changer for me.Because I am an obsessive person, this has given me a positive thing to obsess over (so like, instead of obsessing over my IG feed or TikTok videos, I now obsess over steps walked and goals hit).My suggestion is if you are thinking about getting this, just try it out! You can always return it if it doesn't work out.Oh, I also like the sleep tracker! It makes me WANT to go to bed earlier so I can wake up and find out ""how I did."" lol!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Best Tracker!,"I LOVE this tracker! I upgraded from an Alta so I could monitor HR, but’s it so much cooler than the Alta! So easy to turn it to waterproof to shower with it, the zone minutes pushed me to kill my workout too. Seeing a healthier future with this tool! Side note, I bought the metal mesh band from Poy (Amazon) and it took a minute to install and looks awesome!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great fitbit pricepoint with all the features I need,"I bought a cheaper version and exchanged it for this.  I was turned off by fitbit initially because of the price but this was only 15 or so dollars cheaper and works so much better (as expected).  I have an Aria scale too so it made sense to just pay the extra money so everything works.  The app is so much better than the generic ones, you get what you pay for.  I had a fitbit when they first came out and this one is just as reliable but with more features.  As with the other reviewers, I share the sentiment with the activity boost, I don't think it is necessary but I just ignore it.  The sleep tracker is great.  The step counter and HR are pretty accurate.  Comes with a year of premium so that's a plus.  Battery life is amazing at almost 2 weeks for me.  It is a basic fitbit but for the price, you really cannot beat it.  Do not even bother with the cheap ones!  I learned my lesson."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Cute and Practical and Great for it's Price.,"I've been using this product for two weeks now. So far I absolutely love it. My only downside to it is that it seems like the measurements on the app are more complicated than they need to be and my complaint is mostly with the sleep app. I went from a Fitbit Flex2 to this Inspire2 and everything was easy to read with the Flex2. Maybe it's just me because I don't necessarily need the extra flashiness in the app, or maybe it's because I got the one year of free premium and perhaps that's what I'm not liking as much.As a device, this is excellent. I love the watch feature, which I previously didn't have. I changed my clock to  also have a little raccoon face which is adorable. I LOVE that the wristband is similar to a belt. My Flex2 had a little ball that snapped into the hole. I feel this is more secure.I haven't tried swimming or showering with this yet, so I have no opinion on this.I love that it has an exercise feature where I can track my exercising minutes. One thing I use at home a lot is our stationary bike, but I use the treadmill workout for that since the biking requires GPS and I'm obviously not going anywhere.I think that this is overall a cute and practical tracker and great for it's price."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very Comfortable and BETTER than the Charge 4,"I bought the Charge 4 in October 2020 and in less than 6 months, one of the black side pieces broke off.  I am not someone who beats the thing up.  I wear it for normal step tracking, sleep monitoring and to measure heart beat rate.  So, I decided to get another Fitbit, but not the Charge 4.  I read the reviews on the Inspire 2 and found most people were very pleased with it.  The band is VERY comfortable (more so than the Charge 4) and it does the same things I was using the Charge 4 for.  I also bought a screen protector (separately) for the Inspire 2 and that was very easy to apply.  I like the Fitbit brand because I do find the heart beat rate is pretty accurate, along with the step count.  I would NOT buy another Charge 4 again, but would recommend the Inspire 2.  It was easy to sync up with my Fitbit app and ""picked up"" where my Charge 4 ""left off"" at."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Best budget Fitbit,Got tired of the Apple Watch inaccuracy. So many weird reads on heart rate and miscalculations on steps. Had a Versa before this but accidentally broke it. I realized I don’t need anything fancy as I have a smart watch but what I really missed his the premium fitness and health calculations of the Fitbit. Saw this Inspire 2 on sale for the holidays and figured why not. Works perfect! Great readings on sleep and heart rate. Much better accuracy with step counting. Incredible battery life! Only thing that sucked was the band. The silicon have never a strange dry rash? Weird. But not a big issue as there’s a plethora of alternate bands on Amazon compatible with this model.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Accountability and accomplishments in 2021,"Oh boy did my chunky bum need this little gadget! 2020 was either the year people got their fitness game strong or one that swirled a person into deep depression and self comfort (with lots of junk food to help fill the  time alone). Let’s just say I wasn’t in the former group. After getting on a scale after nearly a year of lockdown, I was sad to see that the quarantine 15 had hit hard.I decided to treat myself to a fitness watch, but I really didn’t need all the bells and whistles the Apple Watch has. I just wanted a way to account my movements throughout the day as I wasn’t always carrying my phone. So after reviewing several options, I settled on this one as I felt it was exactly what I needed.The watch syncs to my phone and MyFitnessPal app. I’m able to track calories in and calories out. Since purchasing, not only have I’ve lost several pounds, but I’m excited to get up and moving. I love getting notifications of accomplished goals. I love having some accountability back into my life in 2021."

What a beast...This thing does everything the Versa did EXCEPT, it does not have a color display and it does not do flights of stairs (no barometer/altimeter).I don’t need fancy ... I need functional.  This is functional. It works as advertised.Maybe Fitbit is finally the company that Google don’t ruin?  If not, this is my last Fitbit.I’ve tested with both the Apple iPhone 12 mini, Apple iPhone 12 and the Samsung Galaxy Note.I’ll answer questions."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love this Fitbit model!,"Major upgrade from previous fitbits!I had the charge 3 model for a couple of years and it was a glitchy model. It would take forever to sync and sometimes would never sync and required a reboot. The battery drained fast. It was the worst. I was thinking about replacing it, but haven't walked as much as I usually do since the pandemic, so didn't want to make the expense. But I ended up losing it, and I still like to use the Fitbit to track the steps I do get to take, sleep tracking, etc.I saw this model on sale on Amazon during the holidays as well as a free year of their paid membership. So, I decided to take the plunge and purchase it.This model is so much better! It's a smaller body, not as bulky on my wrist. It syncs quickly and the battery life is much much longer, lasts over a week. The readings are very accurate, the app works the same as usual, and I love that I can use the ""water lock"" to lock the screen and I think that helps save battery life."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Buzzing isn't that bad -- does the job for me!,"Honestly the buzzing people are complaining about didn't bother me. It does buzz every now and then but it's not that noticeable to me. This is my first fitbit and I'm really enjoying this much better than I thought I would. The white color is a beautiful off-white cream, and the silicone band is easy to clean and very comfortable. Sleep tracking is automatic and works good enough for me to get an idea of how much I am sleeping each night, and I like that the app shows what time you went to sleep and what time you woke up. I love the count down timer and alarms you can set. Sometimes it does misread certain exercises -- for example it counted my tennis as ""swimming,"" but I don't mind that. Oh, and the battery really does last 10 days! All in all beats the cheap $30 fitness tracker I bought that I had to charge every day by a long shot."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Works as supposed. Good value.,"I got this piece to participate in our month of health challenge at work. I have other trackers which are not listed in cadtlight. Gladly this piece was on sale. Haven't used it to full potential, only for step counts so far. It doesn't only register your walk. Looks like it registers your arm movement. I get about 100 steps each minute of hula hooping. Syncing takes a moment, then takes another moment to be reflected in cast light. Be patient and all works well. Got it on Monday evening. Wore every day. First charging (except for the initial) was day 10, Friday, with 29% left. Not bad! There's an extra piece of band in the package if someone needs the band longer. I didn't start the Premium trial for I don't feel necessary. Fitbit app is sufficient for now. I wear it while washing up and brushing, but now in the shower yet. Supposedly it can be worn in the shower, but I feel it'd be in the way while I lather up. So far I am very satisfied with it."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",How to fix the step count issue. Fitbit works great.,"I was not sure whether to buy this with all of the negative reviews but I took the risk. I almost returned it when it started subtracting steps like everyone else complained about but o did some research as I didn’t want to just return it.Turns out, if you remove the health and/or watch app from your iPhone (I never used these), it stops changing your step count when you connect your Fitbit to the Fitbit app. It seems the various apps are competing on counting steps and unless you carry your phone everywhere, your phone step counting overwrites the Fitbit step count.Hope that helps others because I really like this Fitbit."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","TL/DR Not a smartwatch, an EXCELLENT fitness tracker","Love the look. Lightweight and unobtrusive. Easy to sleep with- I usually find accessories or additional layers hard to sleep in... not this device. Pretty intuitive and easy to use if you know how to use any electronics- got two of em, wife is not ""gadget inclined"" but is in LOVE with hers. Love the exercise presets for quickly tracking a workout. Recently went on a hard walk with lots of stairs for about 20 mins during lunch break, didnt track it on purpose to test autotracking- worked perfectly. Fave feature by far is active zone mins tracking, the reason I got it, to test the efficiency of workouts. Very motivational using basic human psychology just like kids and stickers; sounds stupid but you'll be surprised how quickly you're obsessing over earning the lil stars and fireworks and attaboys.Adressing common complaints:No onboard GPS (bluetooth connected to phone only): didn't think I would be using the GPS at all but recently took it for a spin tracking a 2 mile walk/run and was AMAZED at how accurate the mapping was.  All the data that was available as soon as I was done only makes me want to use walk/run tracking more. Was very easy to navigate. I dont mind pairing with my phone for this but if you absolutely cant have your phone on you for a run you need tracked I guess you should get a smartwatch.Limited notification/response options: not looking to replace my phone with my tracker. If you are, get a smartwatch. (Personally, having my wrist buzz for every scam likely or solicitation txt seems miserable, I havent enabled notifications at all and probably wont ever)No digital pay: not looking to pay for things with my tracker. If you are, get a smartwatch.Too much ""buzzing"": never had an issue with buzzing when I dont want it. Manage your notification settings. Sounds like user incompetence to me.Some will miss GPS and pay. This isnt a smartwatch and isnt for them. What this is is an excellent fitness tracker, motivator and accountability partner. My first tracker so I didnt know what to expect... turns out its everything I kinda thought it would be and more. A few years ago I lost big weight (80lbs) but in recent years (especially quarantine) have found myself riding the 15 lbs up, 15 lbs down coaster over and over. I feel confident that with my inspire 2 those days are over. It tracks you, but then with the app it helps you learn about yourself, analyze your patterns, and adjust accordingly. It takes the guess work out. Any complaints I have are with the app, not the tracker, but to be clear I will definitely continue to pay for fitbit premium after the ONE YEAR FREE TRIAL is over. The app is making me look at things I never thought of, such as how to improve the quality of my sleep, taking an honest look at my water consumption, the power of meditation, and a deep dive into macronutrients besides just ""protein good, carbs bad"". Also it's very customizable, easy to hide info you're not concerned with and prioritize data categories that matter to you. If I could, I would make the workouts streamable to a tv or other large display (or make a companion smart tv/streaming device app); since they're not I dont use em. I wish you could customize the name of your workouts on the app for easier identification of exactly what you did which day when comparing efficiency (for example, labeling certain days ""A circuit"" or ""B circuit""). Other than those minor tweaks I find the app super helpful and will gladly spend 9.99/mo on premium (formerly vending machine cash anyway) once trial is up.Bottom line, I never thought I needed a fitness tracker, but now I can't imagine not having THIS one."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",been a trend setter for me,"I've somewhat made myself turn total control over to this fitbit device :-) and it's starting to pay off already.  I'm not the biggest fan of the sleep tracker since I can never seem to have it stay on correctly.  However I thought the data it's recorded so far showed I was getting some rather mediocre rest early on, but things are trending better as I'm losing lbs.  The best things for me are the simplest things the device offers: total steps, total water intake, days exercised, active hours and heart rate.  Those things are the key components, and along with a sleek look this device is pretty solid at $70 or so with tax."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love Inspire 2,"I love my Fitbit Inspire 2.  I previously had Fitbit Alta, but the battery life on that quickly died after couple years.  It says that the battery life on Fitbit Inspire 2 lasts 10 days.  Mine actually lasts 23 days.  I charge mine on the 24th day and the remaining battery percentage on it on the 23rd day is 8%.  Pretty much my fitbit uses about 3-4% a day.  I love all the features on this fitbit especially the sleep tracking and exercise tracking.  Although it is waterproof, I don't use it when I shower because I don't want to have to deal with drying it.  The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the original fitbit band.  It's too bulky so I bought a thinner band that's super soft and flexible."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great motivatior to get fit!,"I am really impressed with my new fit bit!  I’ve had it a month and love it.  Love the sleep tracking.  I thought I was sleeping WAY too much but found out I was actually getting quite poor quality sleep.  Also my resting heart rate was alarmingly high.  I am a previous athlete/ naturally thin but not exercising much like I used to  I started trying to walk a minimum of 10,000 steps a day and gave up my glasses of wine at night and saw my heart rate steadily drop from 85 bpm to 65bpm in a month.  I could track my weight loss (5.5 pounds) and my sleep steadily improved from poor to good.  It’s very motivating trying to get to 10k, 15k or even past 20k steps a day.  You can set goals to walk a minimum steps per hour and get a subtle buzz vibration reminder that you need to get moving.  It motivated me to give up my nightly wine and even eat better since it showed I was burning fewer calories than I thought.  The app syncs quickly to the fit bit and it’s interesting to see results over a length of time.  So far I have only charged my fit bit once since the initial charge.  I only paid $66 for this and have been very happy with it"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Excellent motivator! Makes tracking  your health goals kind'a fun!,"I'm not much of a tech gal, but I've really enjoyed my fit bit. Its been helpful in tracking my sleep quality and water intake, but surprisingly, its really prompted me to increase my movement during the day. I was surprised to see how many steps I do take on an average day without actually trying to increase my movement and its always fun to track my walks. Best of all, I find that I look forward to checking my stats and that 'Gold star for a second grader feeling of accomplishment' is so fun that I look for the time in my schedule to add a walk or some yoga.I still need to investigate some of the features further, but just the basics make it super valuable for me.I highly recommend the Aspire 2.I should clarify that the only reason I gave it only 4 stars for accuracy is that I just don't know. My husband has an older model and our walks together usually come out with slightly different numbers. But that could be due to the fact that he has longer legs or?????"

Two weeks in, I’ve noticeably improved my sleep time!Counting my steps in-home was an eye opener, too. Lots of steps occur while house cleaning which aren’t captured by the pedometer on my phone.Reporting on stationary time also (sadly) revealing. Way too much of that. That’s why the 250 steps per hour 9a-6p are so useful! I put on a favorite song and dance for 3-5 minutes.Very easy entry of my foods — the database has practically every food listed and lots of options for listing serving quantities ... PLUS instant nutritional report summaries!! Counts water, too.Fun facts attached to milestones ... and a well-formatted summary emailed to me weekly!!!Love, love, love the professionalism, simplicity, and thoroughness of this tool. It’s helping me to make better choices.I lost 4lbs in two weeks, right off the bat, by making small adjustments to my daily routine."

The buzzing can be controlled. This is awesome! I had purchased a Garmin it was trash sent it back. I got this instead cheaper. I use it for everything. Tracks my sleep, heart rate, love when I do weights I can see if I am in fat burn mode. Doing cycling I am in cardio mode lets  me know if I am at peak.  It tracks steps, heart rate pretty accurate. Works with Strava. I get to figure out what workouts will keep me in cardio or fatburn mode. Its worth the money and I like the free membership trial. I will keep it. Worth the money cheaper than Garmin easy to use, and understand. The only Con was it left a mark on my arm. I just loosened it and it still works well. Worth it. Love that it breaks down quality of sleep Rem vs Deep sleep. Restlessness and updates me on resting heart rate gives  me a report end of the week. Battery power is Amazing literally wear it fir ten days before you need a charge. Extremely happy with my purchase!"

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very easy to use and long battery.,"Long battery life, will detect on its own whenever you do an exercise.  Has all the necessary features to follow up activities and exercise.  Started logging food and water intake - it helps you to detect were the Xtra calories are.  Battery life over one week.Previously purchased an expensive Apple Watch which was completely disappointing.  Did not detect at all when I went out on a jog or walked.  Had to start an app which required using my reading glasses and then you need to stop the app (imposible with sweaty hands).  Lastly after three months the display shattered just by doing house work.  Battery only lasted a day.  The Fitbit is a much better solution.Sleep accuracy for both the Fitbit is about the same as an Apple Watch (whenever I read in bed it is detected as sleeping)."

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love my Fitbit inspire,"I bought the Fitbit in January originally to track my daily steps.  I started a weight loss plan in February and have found the app invaluable in helping me to track my daily food, water and calorie intake in addition to my steps and sleep.The Fitbit vibrates when I get a phone call or text.  I can read the texts on the Fitbit.  I can set timers on the Fitbit so I can schedule my meals, etc.I don’t think the steps are completely accurate.  If your arm moves a lot while sitting it may cause steps to register on the Fitbit.  The sleep tracking is pretty accurate, but doesn’t always start tracking right away.  It is based on your heart rate.  Overall I love it.  I am certain My weight loss plan is more successful because of the Fitbit and daily accountability."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love it no buzzing like other reviews said,I love this it as been a big help tracking my sleep didn’t realize how much sleep I don’t get also I check in the app to see what my heart rate was while I was asleep. Seeing the calories I have burned is nice too. I don’t know what those other reviews are saying about it vibrating I’ve only had it vibrated a couple of times and it was when I reached a certain amount of steps. Maybe they put notifications on or something. Well I really recommend this it’s awesome and looks cute too.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Exactly What I Needed!,"I was hesitant to purchase at first due to all the reviews mentioning excessive vibration. It does vibrate frequently but it's very light, and you eventually stop noticing it. The sleep tracking is accurate and gives me a sleep score for almost every night. The heart rate is also accurate. The mobile app has many features, but also offers the flexibility in allowing you to turn off whatever you don't use. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Muy bueno fit bit inspire 2,"Me encanta el diseño, sus funciones, lo único es que le falta la medición de presión y oxígeno.  Aun no logro bloquearlo para poder nadar o en la bañera.  Esa función no la he podido activar cuando es necesario.  Dice que lo hace automático al nadar pero no lo hace, y se pone un poco loco corriendo en pantalla todas las funciones.  La duración de batería es muy buena, un poco mas de una semana.  A veces para configurar si se necesita un límite de frecuencia cardiaca como es mi caso, en en ejercicio no puedo pasarme de 150 mlp por mi hipertensión, logré establecer el límite por medio de una pc entrando a mi cuenta, y no en la app porque no lo permite.  Pero a pesar de sus fallas y faltantes es un reloj que me encanta."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",I would definitely recommend this for product!,"This is my first review. I had to review it because i wanted to address some of the negative reviews i thought upon purchasing. I had the Fitbit Alta HR. It worked great until it no longer held a charge. I purchased the Inspire 2 in its place and it does what is expected. I wanted out of this product was to monitor my HR, track and record my exercise, calorie information. That pretty much it. I’m still adjusting to it and learning to sleep with it on. I usually take all my jewelry off when i sleep so I’m not so consistent with wearing the band to bed. I think it’s pretty accurate with all the information. The app is extremely easy to navigate, which was a necessity; i am by no means tech savvy and if i can’t figure it out within a few clicks it’s a no for me. The most common review i read was that the watch consistently vibrates. Makes sense because the sensors are on the sides so whenever you flex your wrist it lights up. Yes it’s a little annoying but manageable, i loosen the straps so when i do move my wrist it’s not activating the sensors. Even still i think i get pretty accurate reports.Hope this helps someone else interested in this product"

It doesn't take long.It took me a moment to figure out all the settings, but I like the timer, activity reminders, and sleep tracking. That's before getting a premium subscription. Challenging friends to meet daily step goals has been motivating and I love it.The watch isn't large and clunky. It's perfect!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",I love my Fitbit inspire 2,"I’m new to the world of fitness tracking. I did my research and saw that the Fitbit Inspire 2 is worth considering. For just under $100, it keeps track of your calories, heart rate, miles, steps, and workouts each day, and your sleep stages, breathing, and heart rate variability at night!! I enjoy the slim look,  it’s also never in the way at work. I've even started to forget that I'm wearing it most of the time, which might just be one of its biggest selling points if I'm honest. SO COMFORTABLE.I think I can safely say that if you're going to get a fitness band, it's going to be really hard to pass up the Inspire 2."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Best Bang for My Buck,"I’m really pleased with this overall! I’m not an athlete by any means, so this is perfect. It has alot of bells and whistles for the price for sure. This device does rely heavily on the app, just in case this is important. I have to often go to the app just to see sleep tracking, even though there’s a dedicated section on my tracker. But I love the size, and all that it can do. I love the battery life as well—it just makes it that much easier to wear on a routine basis. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially if they are starting out. If accuracy were my thing, I would have paid to get the charge 4 for the built in gps. But since i’m starting out, just the encouragement to get out there makes all the difference."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Nice,"I strayed away from Fitbits when we had an issue with 1 my husband had gotten and that they had very few reasonably priced ones that you could actually change the bands.  My band had broken on my 1st one, so I had to get a whole new tracker.  I decided to try this one for 2 reasons - ability to change the band and the price.  I wear mine all the time (including when I sleep to monitor my heart).  I charge it 1 time a week when I shower.  I like the app, but I can say that I don't use it much.  Just a quick look here and there when I get light headed to make sure my pulse rate isn't too low, but I get what I need mainly from the Inspire."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very comfortable and lightweight,"I got this to replace the Inspire HR, not even aware at first that the Inspire 2 is an upgrade from the Inspire HR. I have several different bands of different materials that I like to swap to match what I’m wearing or doing, and I wasn’t sure if they’d fit the Inspire 2, but they do. The Timers are a new feature for me, and they are very handy! I also appreciate the free trial 1 year premium subscription, although I won’t be paying the $10 a month when it expires. But to get this one for less than I paid for the HR, with a free subscription addd, was very nice (I got it on Prime Day, so the deal I got may not be available any more)."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Got me into fitness again,"I got 7 days out of my fitbit from 100% to 0%. Slim band makes it feel as if there's nothing on my wrist at all, and it's easy to fall asleep with. Heart rate seems accurate for me, and my steps are maybe 600 overestimated from my usual activity where I used to wear a Samsung Galaxy Watch (both original and Active2). Sleep tracker is accurate for me. Mobile app is user friendly, and if you don't have your fitbit or you forget it and need your steps, you can use their Mobile Trak app which allows the fitbit app to count steps via your phone until you have your fitbit back on your person. Would recommend 10/10."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",A very good choice!,"I was utterly heartbroken when my six year (six years!) Fit Bit Flex finally got too tired and I couldn't replace it, but then came along the Inspire 2!It has way more features, is easier to use, tells you what time it is, synced up immediately, but......the most important thing of all, the battery lasts like ten days at a time. So it really can do a resting heart rate, tell me how long I slept. So far I think I've only charged it twice.Another super important thing, you won't lose it, it's a watch band, as opposed to the snaps.And, it was cheaper than my original fitbit!!!! My original was over 100 bucks, in May of 2014, and this was only 69!I love it and since I got the new one have lost three pounds because I'm actually seeing real progress. Gotta work off that Quarantine 15!!!!"

Steps and everything else is as good as expected.,"I bought the FitBit Inspire 2 primarily for tracking steps.  I was impressed quickly at the record of my heart rate and my evidence of increased activity when I exercised.  I like the hourly reminder to move when I'm having a lazy day!BUT, the best surprise is the sleep record provided by the free Premium membership that is a gift with a new device.  It is amazing to see the hours of sleep at the various levels.  It is SUCH a good record that I have bought one for my elderly mother in order to provide an accurate record of her sleeping patterns to her doctors.WOW!  What a great value!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love it,"This is my first fitness tracker. I got the Fitbit for the step counter feature to help me track my recovery from an injury and get going again. I have a small (about 5.5 inch wrist) so I got the smallest model. I was afraid it might be too big but it fits perfectly, with a few notches to spare.I read reviews that the watch would buzz when the wrist moved and that the sleep tracker wouldn't work. I have had none of those problems. I really like the sleep tracker and the insights I get about how and when I move. I like this Fitbit a lot more than I was expecting and I'm using more features than just the step counter."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",More comfortable and better battery life,"I upgraded to this from the Inspire HR. It was money well spent. The Inspire 2 is more comfortable, both during the day and when sleeping. The battery life is about twice that of the previous version. I only need to charge it about once a week. And all the other great stuff is there, like the Fitbit App which is top notch."

It doesn't spin around on my wrist, the slim face/band looks appropriate for me, the data is accurate.Price was great, even beating the sale in the FitBit store.

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","Love it, but I would change one thing!","I’m loving my FitBit. I haven’t gotten a new one since my Charge, the very first one! So this has a lot of new things I’m not used to.... but all are welcome improvements.The one thing I really don’t like is how touchy the sides are, I have to wear it higher up on my wrist so that if my hand moves and my wrist touches one side and my arm hits the other it doesn’t pause my workouts. Not so important if you’re using it mostly for running, but I lift a lot so when I do a snatch or anything that my wrists bend it effects it a lot.Other than that it’s really useful and keeps me motivated."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Works very well,Had for a week. Bought to replace my fitbit Charge which had replaced my 2nd Zip-the gateway tracker. It comes attached to wristband by a clip on top and bottom so it is not a slide in wristband like the charge. App has more features compared to non-HR recording trackers. It automatically detects your sleep and analyzes for sleep quality. You can set it to nag you when you haven’t taken enough steps. It can sync with your phone to vibrate when your phone rings. Despite recording more stuff continuously it doesn’t run low. I’m on the 50th hour of my last charge and it’s at 90%.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Helps keep me on track for weight loss,"First off I must say that I am one of those people who typically hate having anything on my wrist. That being said, I decided I would give the Fitbit Inspire 2 a try. It's not as annoying as I was prepared to expect. Most of the time I forget I am even wearing it.Once you get the reminders set (that is kind of tricky), it'll buzz to remind you to get up and move. It'll also buzz when you do something notification-worthy.I'm looking to lose weight and my Fitbit is keeping me on track. I signed up for the 1yr free Premium pkg and I like the Sleep Score and the new Stress Score so I will probably continue with the paid plan after the free trial is up."

I flew home thinking I would buy the same Inspire HR I gifted mom as I really enjoyed it. However, the Inspire 2 was on sale and opted for it instead. Glad I did!! Style is a little bit nicer and a free year of fitbit premium is offered with purchase! Great deal!! So many options I would have never known about had it not been for the free trial!! I am sure I will continue when the free trial expires and had even bought a scale to connect to the fitbit as well!!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",So much fun!,"I had no idea how much this little guy would actually inspire me to get more active!! And it’s fun! It sets little goals every day, and it celebrates you when you reach a goal. This is my first time getting any of these trackers. I was nervous about the accuracy and so I didn’t want to spend a bunch of money on something that wasn’t going to be any better than my cell phone. But I am really impressed! And I love the sleep tracking it does! It shows me my REM sleep, and if I’m restless at night, etc. which is just cool to know about.The mobile app is cool too. It keeps track of so many things! I got a year’s subscription of Premium included, and I know after a year, I’m going to want to keep it going. There’s just so much there. I absolutely recommend this device to anyone who’s not sure about what Fitbit to get, and who doesn’t need all the newest bells and whistles. This is a smart buy."

My husband has one as well and it never appealed to me. However I wanted to prioritize my health and decided to take the chance. All of it is touch screen and so far it seems pretty easy to figure out. The font looks classy and the AP is simple to navigate with way more ways to track my health than I imagined. Finally, it also fits my ity bitty wrist which almost never happens. It came with a large strap as well which I won't need but its nice to have it for others with normal sized wrists. Overall, very pleased with this product."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Beware: DO NOT wear it too tight!,"I'm writing this review to alert others not to wear this watch too tight, I use it to track my sleep and I forgot to losen it on one night, see what happened to my skin in the morning in attached photos due to fraction and sheer from the watch to my wrist skin. It looks like a faint sun burn that's peeling off luckily nothing too serious, but since then I moved it to the other wrist and I continue to wear it lose all the time with no issue.This is not a negative review by any mean, on the contrary I think this is a reason not to buy a cheap alternative that might heat up and cause more damage in such situations, fitbit accuracy remains the same to me even after losen it up all the time. I like the buzzing alarm way more than my phone alarm, battery life is superb and very nice app too."

My Son is into weight lifting, martial arts but didn’t think he’d use this. I thought the Amazon Prime Day Deal was worth the trial and if use it if he didn’t like.

The price is great. I can’t say enough about this Fitbit
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",A nice beginner’s tracker/watch,"It does everything I need it to do, it’s comfortable whenever I wear it to sleep, it doesn’t make a loud noise or anything for notifications, it’s more of a vibration. It came with an extra strap if I needed it to be longer, so that’s a plus that they didn’t charge more unlike Apple where they charge $ for a longer strap. I do get messages and it alerts me for phone calls but again, this is a tracker and you can only reply thru your phone and not the watch. The Fitbit app is also useful for logging things and a few other stuff, definitely take advantage of the free 1 year trial it gives. I got this to help with reminders bc I have diagnosed ADHD as well as track my activity. I will update this if it occurs to me in a few months."

There are half hour or longer gaps in a single night's sleep.  Aside from that, however, it is great.  The fitness tracker is excellent.  The heart rate monitor has allowed me to clearly see what excites me, relaxes me or makes me uncomfortable.  There are also timers and stop watches that work very well.  I am thoroughly enjoying the free year of the pro version of the app."

This Fitbit is perfect!! It gives you a year of premium membership for FREE. I never even cared about sleep tracking but now I do. I will continue to use this throughout my fitness journey to make sure I’m doing a calorie deficit properly!It also allows you to read text messages and other things but I keep my watch on do not disturb, I use the app a lot more than the watch. I personally think the watch is small and cute."

It has a much longer battery life than Inspire 1. It comes with a free year of premium. I love all of the features. However, my favorite is the heart rate variability feature. This is an important part of heart health. Nice not to have to buy an expensive measurement device just for that one reading.It's compact. I love the constant heart rate monitor and the sleep statistics as well. I'm using the buzz reminders to move every hour and to drink water.Just a great product."

I know there are knock off brands cheaper but I like how simple the app is for Fitbit. This one tracks your steps, calories burned, sleep, HR, and active minutes (when your HR is above 100 and you are exercising). I like the notifications it sends me to get up and move every hour to hit 250 steps. As a total surprise, my text messages from my phone come onto it and it vibrates when someone is calling me and shows the name or number of who is calling! Total bonus!"

It counted over 4,000 steps the first day on an inactive day when I didn’t leave the house. The second day I watched carefully, found it added 60 steps in the ten minutes I sat and drank coffee. By the time I finished my 3 cups of coffee and working crosswords, I had 602 steps. I am disappointed. I am returning it.Amazon delivered a replacement to me the following day and it is working well, no problems!"

I’ve been wanting something more in depth and this was a perfect fit for me:Overall feel:- The tracker is slim, comfortable, and feels light on my wrist. I haven’t experienced any issues with the band irritating my skin and I sleep with it just fine. I take it off when I get in the shower just to give my wrist a bit of a break and get cleaned up!- Unlike a lot of other comments here, I don’t experience a constant buzzing sensation. Nor does my wrist pinch the buttons on either side to cause the buzz.Steps/calories burned:- Similarly to other comments, I do feel as though the step counter is a tad inaccurate. It does seem to pick up on some movements that aren’t steps. However this isn’t something that is too important to me.- As far as the calories burned, I feel like this is fairly accurate. The calories I burn on my Fitbit seem to match up with what my Apple Watch stated.The app:- I absolutely LOVE the features and the app itself. The sleep analytics are so much more advanced and I love having a place to track my water, calorie intake, menstrual cycle, activity, and more.- The premium free trial is great too. I really enjoy the fitness class library! I stream it to the tv at home and get some home workouts in.Overall, for the price, analytics, and 1-year free premium trial, it’s worth every penny! I would say give it a shot!"

I wanted a smart watch but not all the frills with apps like Facebook, Insta, or emails. I didnt need to answer texts w it or anything just my daily steps, sleep and heart rate. This is all of that in a slim design. And my steps, with the app, are calculated into daily weekly monthly miles which is pretty cool personally. I average about 70 miles a week! That's CRAZY!!! Worth every penny and easy to change bands to match outfits! Love my Fitbit Inspire 2!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","Good for heart rate, bad for anything else","I enjoy this watch as a minimalists watch, but I probably wouldn't ever buy it again. I work in a home improvement store, in their Lumber department so I'm using my hands all day long. Thus, any small movement counts as a step, calories burned, miles (or kilometers? it tracks that too), and heart rate. There's another few but I don't remember what they are off the top of my head.Battery life is great! Charge it on a Monday morning, and you'll be charging again maybe on Friday! So that's a plus from me.I don't trust ""calories burned"", because I know for SURE I don't burn 4,000 calories during work. So I chalked that up to gross over-exaggeration.I also don't trust ""steps taken"" because as I said before, any flick of the wrist will count as a step.All in all it's a cute little watch, but for the large inaccuracies, I wouldn't buy it for the $99 dollar price tag."

If you want a simple device to monitor your movement, sleep, heart rate, and water intake like I did, you’ll love the Inspira. It still has the clean, user friendly app with a smaller wrist profile. I find it has the same accuracy as my previous Charge model."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Worth it!,"I really like this fitbit! It has been everything I hoped for and more. It took me a little bit to learn how to navigate it, but now I wear it more than I wore my old one!Sleep tracking is good for the most part...it is a little spotty with when you actually fall asleep sometimes. I've found it helpful to see how restless I can be, along with my sleeping heart rate.Accuracy is pretty much spot on. Sometimes it's a little overzealous with steps, but that's ok.Overall, if you're looking for a simple tracking device, go for it! 👏🏼"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Simply put...,"It is a lot more simple compared to the Charge 3. I had a Charge 3 for quite a while (years), before the streaks of death appeared after taking it off of the charger. Anyways, I saw the Inspire 2 on sale for a great price and thought what the hell. It's great! It works just as well. It seems to be a more updated version, but also a more simple version. It still tracks my sleep, my steps, and any exercise accurately. However, it does not show me the weather. Not a problem though, because I am a simple girl and it works wonderful."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Keeping me on track.,"I love this Fitbit.  It has really helped me stay on track with my fitness in the form of moving, exercising, drinking the recommended amount of water, and tracking my calories (which, personally, I'm not a fan of but at least gives me an idea of calories going in vs. calories going out) and heartbeat.  I also love the reminders and alerts it sends. But you also have the option to turn these off via activating Do Not Disturb (DND).  I've always been into exercise, proper eating and fitness for quite a number of years and thought I was doing enough but this tracker made me aware that, especially as I get older, I need a little more of a push and move a little more."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love it,"This watch is amazing. it encourages me to work out harder, get more sleep, get more steps etc. It's user friendly, with so many features to track your progress. I've had it a week now, and learn new things everyday. Play with the app, you'll learn all its capabilities as you go. You can zoom in on all the graphs, it tracks your steps seemingly VERY accurately. & the zone minute feature is awesome!!! it really encourages you to keep your heart rate up in the burn/cardio windows. This little watch I bought for $70 is seriously going to be the key to keeping me accountable and having fun all the meanwhile being ACCURATE. I absolutely love & recommend it to anyone. (I actually got a coworker of mine to get one too!) BUY IT!"

I am so glad that I did.  I was a bit nervous about setting it up on my phone, but it was super easy to do.  I had no problems at all.  I also stepped out of my comfort zone and bought the rose/black one, instead of my usual color of black.  I love it.  The color is great and it goes with a lot of things. The screen is clear and very easy to read.  I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","If you don't need a lot of features, it's perfect.","I bought this to replace my Charge 3, which died at the end of its warranty. I chose the Inspire 2 because I didn't need all the new features on the Charge 4, the price difference is significant, and the profile is smaller.I love it. It does almost everything the Charge 3 did. The only thing I miss is elevation change-- it doesn't sense going up and down hills or stairs.One feature the Inspire 2 has that the Charge 3 and 4 don't have, is you can put it on a fob to attach to your clothing. I have a wristwatch collection that I can show off and still keep track of my steps!"

Many fun options and it motivates me to get moving. I wish the screen was easier to read. Sometimes I cannot see what the time is, etc. I’ve noticed that this device tracks walking distance as greater than that tracked by my phone. Also, mileage on my bike doesn’t come up. Maybe need GPS for that option. Love tracking my swimming which is great. I’ve ruined past devices as they were not water resistant"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love it!,"I got used to wearing this wrist fitbit very quickly (Don't like watches). Loved the HR monitor, Step counter and route tracking. That's all I needed it for; however,  it did start to irritate my skin, so I ordered the clip for it. No skin irritation with the clip, but it won't trach HR, or sleep when on a clip.  Still happy I bought it. It's definitely encouraging me to get up and add/feed steps to my little step tracker.  :D"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","Inspire2 not too big on your wrist, yet readable display","I got this to replace a Fitbit Zip over a month ago. I was reluctant at first because I was concerned that having something on my wrist would bother me, but have found that it doesn't! It's not as big as other trackers, which I like, yet is big enough for me to see. The sleep hour count seems low to me, and I have a cpap that agrees with me. The step counter seems a bit generous to me, but not too far off. I like the hourly reminder to move, tracking active minutes per week, and ability to track a workout. The app shows more stats than the device can, and I like to check those out. All in all, I think this is a great reliable device for a reasonable price and has the features I wanted plus some extras that I didn't know I wanted.  The desert rose option is a great coral color that I really love."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Most inexpensive way to track your steps and keep track of your exercise progress.,"Does exactly what I need it to do, tracks my step count. Supposed to track sleep and so far I can't seem to get that function to work, but that just might be me not knowing what I should be doing to tell it I'm sleeping and not just stopped. Also Pulse rate so you have some idea how much of a workout your giving yourself. Oh and it tells time so it's a basic watch too. I don't need anything more and I can't figure out why people pay way more for all sorts of fancier sports trackers than this. Perfect fit of function to need. the FitBit app is also nice and the ability of others in your friends and family to challenge you through the app to competitive walking/step challenges is a good way to use ones natural competitive nature to improve fitness even more. Overall perfect for my needs."

So turn off the 10-min MOVE reminders!  Sheesh!  This is great — far and above a better device than the Versa I had previously.  Only “complaint” is that Fitbit only wants to give me three months of Premium free of charge with an annual charge after that time.  I read articles in the Fitbit forum and hope by cancelling, in three days’ time I will have opportunity to take advantage of 1-year Premium for FREE.  (NOTE:  I was never a Premium customer with the Versa.)"

IVE LOST 12LB so far!I seriously tried about 6 other trackers online (cheap and ones) within a span of 2months before finally just paying the extra money and buying this.

I am broke ish I am in point shoes on the black line. Anyways I went with the Fitbit Inspire 2 it was very important that it be waterproof and have a heart monitor. I like when my anxiety kicks in and I feel like I am dying but then I look at my wrist and my heart rate is normal. It tracks everything very well. I personally think it tracks my sleep better than the Alta HR. Device set up and syncing is easy. It never gives me any grief. No black out screen always syncs have not had to setup my device up more than once. Cute lightweight and excellent battery life. Now if I could just stop binge eating and keep my commitment to work out every day.....

The silicon wristbands were uncomfortable and caused my skin to break out. With the Inspire 2, I'm able to switch out bands to something more comfortable and attractive.

I decided after a few days that I liked it so I kept it. But I noticed it was tracking steps that I really didn’t take. I called customer service and they told me that since it’s a device that’s worn on your wrist it’s going to also track arm/hand movements. He told me he usually deducts 1000 off the total steps by the end of the day and that’s really how many he’s taken. Well I’m ******, I’m Italian! I even talk with my hands when I’m on the phone! I do love this device tho. Just a word of caution as to the screen size. It’s tiny! It looks big, but it’s not."

Not only did I find it to be fun, it was also incredibly useful. With the year of premium I knew this would be the perfect package. A fitness tracker with the longest battery life? And it tracks your swimming, showering, running, or whatever? I couldn't believe it. This is a great product and for the price it’s a great deal. I recommend this to anyone who is committed to the process and with that combined hardware and already sophisticated Fitbit app, it’s a no brainer."

The Fitbit has been a godsend. It is so encouraging and gives reminders to get up. I end up doing way more steps than my goal most days. I have also lost a few pounds which is great too. Several of us at work have one and we are always walking around now o get our steps! Best purchase I’ve probably ever made."

She’ll take naps during the day, and it tallies up how long she sleeps. Mother also likes how she can log her food and water, and it also connects to her phone and buzzes when she gets a call, which is nice since she doesn’t always hear the phone ring."

First of all, this is my very first fitness tracker ever. That may mean my expectations are low but I have absolutely loved this device. I have had absolutely no problems with the vibrating and based on the reviews just wear my Fitbit a bit higher on my wrist. I am definitely walking more and it is so fun to track my exercise that it is getting me off my butt which was the whole point. There was a recent update that now allows your device to track your phone like a tile. I am the most forgetful person and it is seriously life-changing."

I find myself getting up and moving more (gotta get those hourly steps in). I have exercised 5 days a week for the past 6 years, but over the past 3 have gained 25 lbs. I would joke that I would hate to see what I looked like if I didn't regularly exercise! Well, once I started tracking my calories consistently, I now know where that 25 lbs came from! I thought I made good dietary choices, but honestly I did not. I find that the watch and app help to keep me accountable and on track. Gives me everything I need and the price was good."

I didn't have a use for the smart watch versions, so after some research I chose this one. I love it! It is comfortable and sleek, I love the white, and it suits my needs. It's nice that you can add different workouts to track, and I especially love the tennis one. I knew I worked hard on the courts, now I look forward to seeing the stats and steps after playing. It helps keep you aware of activity and motivated.. the app breaks down even more data for activity, which is interesting (haven't tried premium yet) I'm not sure how accurate the sleep setting is, as it sometimes does not record the time asleep properly, but it's cool to have an idea how your sleep cycles go."

I wanted a couple of things and the Fitbit inspire is way better for tracking: steps, sleep, heart rate. The batter life on this thing is great, I ca wear a week and it charges in under an hour aft the wind of the week. The sleep tracking is wonderful and the app has the best sleep insights I’ve seen. Since my purchase i went from 4K to 10k steps a day with the hourly 250 step reminder! Also the heart rate monitor is great for exercise and really tells me when I’m working hard on cardio or YouTube videos and when I’m just doing the motions but not exerting myself. The k my issue I had initially was the “DND” screen would pop up when the watch was squeeze by my wrist backwards, and I “lowered” the sensitivity by checking that I’m wearing it on my dominant hand even though I’m not and loosening a notch for fit."

I was hesitant at first to get one because I loved my Flex 1 and Flex 2. They were simple and stylish. When Fitbit discontinued them, I was very happy to find that the Inspire series offered the same stylish simplicity but with some welcome upgrades. The Inspire 2 allows you to check the time, texts, and emails on the tiny screen and you can see who's calling you when you feel it vibrating because of a call. The battery life is AMAZING. I only have to charge it every week and a half. I highly recommend this for those that liked the Flex and wanted something like it without the entire smart watch upgrade."

You have the ability to see things in real time without having to depend on your phone. Battery life is great on it as well
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",it’s great,"i got nervous when i would walk by wall or through a door frame, i thought it would scratch but to my surprise it doesn’t, i just scrub off the paint that it gets off the walls-if any- and it looks brand new.At first i put it on too tight and it did some weird friction thing with my wrist bone so i put it facing inwards-mistake!! the skin in that part apparently it’s thinner i dunno and the green light the fitbit emits gave me a rash, but i put it on facing outward again and everything went back to normal, and i just put it a little looser so it wouldn’t apply pressure on my bone. It’s a great buy"

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",I love it,"I like how it reminds me to drink water throughout the day, and I like the different exercises it has. I also like the breathing exercises it has for you to do. It's alarms keep me from being late to things, and I love that it's waterproof. The only thing I could critique is that reminders to eat too would be fantastic, but yeah. 5 stars. It's comfortable and scratch resistant from what I can tell, but then again I'm not taking a box cutter to it. I also like the interchangeable bands you can get. Overall I recommend it"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Over all I really do love my Fitbit Inspire 2,Love my Fitbit Inspire 2!! Band was super easy to change out. Tracks sleep and heart rate perfectly. Only thing I suggest is getting a screen protector. Screen was easy to scratch which I did on the second day of owning it. But it was small. Works perfectly with the screen protector on. Only thing I would change is how Fitbit made it so you can activate the do not disturb.. when I bend my wrist up to do something the Fitbit gets caught between the back of my hand and forearm so it clicks the did and gets accidently turned on.Battery life is awesome! I went 10 days without having to charge it!
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Happy wit Fit Bit Inspire 2,I like this device being smaller and slender verses the larger Fit Bits.  I particularly enjoy the accuracy of the sleep tracking feature.  Huge fan of Fit Bit.  Their Customer Service is extremely patient and helpful.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love this thing...,I got a cheap wrist pedometer because I wear it on my andle instead of my wrist and it bit the dust within days.  I decided to go with the Fitbit and am so happy with it.  I accidently took a shower with it on and was surprised to find out that it has a water-lock feature...whew!!  I don't connect it to my computer...I just want to know how many steps I take per day and this does it flawlessly:)
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great addition to a new healthier me!!,"My step tracker has been a great addition for tracking my daily activities, and it's so much more.  Most important, it challenges me to keep it up.  It's also an elegant piece, not bulky like other products. The only downside is that you can't read the screen if you're outside, so you will need to take your cell phone with you and look at the app."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Haven't taken it off,"Started a healthy habit program and this has been on my wrist since I received it (which was next day BTW). The battery life is insane, I have had it two weeks and have only charged it twice! It is accurate, reminds me when I need to get ready for bed, logs how long I sleep and the steps I take daily which is a huge motivator."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Cool sleep tracking,"Upgraded from the Flex 2 recently. I like the new sleep log showing when in REM or deep sleep and the heart rate monitor is nice. I also like that it can be worn while showering or swimming. So far, not disappointed. I only wish they didn’t need to be replaced every couple of years when the battery is worn."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",No Unnecessary Buzzing and Easy to Use,"I have not encountered the issue of repetitive and unnecessary buzzes that other reviewers have mentioned. The tracker is very easy to navigate, I do not have skin rashes at all (despite wearing mine pretty tight), and I especially love the timer and alarms options. The only thing I would say is it is a bit difficult to turn on/off the water lock setting sometimes (it requires a double tap on the screen but I often have to tap the tracker very hard many times - may be a tap sensitivity issue). Overall, the tracker is wonderful and I'm glad I bought it, despite many of the negative reviews I read."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Comfortable fit,I got this to replace a Blaze which I felt was not comfortable to sleep with. This is much better and I find it better for fitness use too. I wish there were more aftermarket band options though. I have some concerns about the scratch resistance of the face because it has a dome-face shape. Time will tell.

I don't need nor want the health trackers that can do all the fancy stuff.  I just wanted a simple Fitbit that kept track of my exercising, steps, sleep and heart rate.  This one does exactly what I need it to do and I absolutely love it."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very nice fitness tracker,"I bought the Inspire 2 to replace my third Charge 4, which had already been replaced twice by Fitbit and was broken again.

I haven't really found anything I don't like about it. For the money, it's great."

It has been such a motivational tool and game changer!  From the 250 steps/hr goals, understanding your sleep habits, tracking heart rate, cardio zones and steps, simple food & water tracking, and meditation makes it is so easy to make small improvements.  Adding Fitbit Premium for a year free has been incredible!  I highly recommend.  If you don’t want it in your wrist, there is a clip for bra or belt.  Heart rate will not track but it’s still great!"

The sleep tracking is awesome too all together a great product to keep track of your health especially if you love working out ! I also use the Apple Watch too just bc I like receiving texts and being able to send texts on the Apple Watch fit bit is sticky for health and fitness give it an A for fitness and sleep tracking and weight loss! But fit bit needs to be replaced a lot if you use it every day it will only last a year than you will have to replace it. All and all worth the money.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love the fit.,"Changed from the Blaze to this and am loving the slim look. Easy to read and comfy on wrist. I did get the extended Two year warranty as the FitBit has no protection around it and the face sticks out a lot, so figure it will get damaged at some point. Has everything I need on it and so easy to setup."

I went to the pool with my kids and now it doesn’t work properly. I’m very disappointed in Amazon as I purchased it from them, there is no easy way to let them know there’s a problem. I’m still searching how to get in touch with them.I love this smart watch. It doesn’t always wake when I move my arm. It tracks my sleep and heart rate wonderfully!"
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very good value.,Love this! The step counter and movement reminders have gotten me moving a lot more. And the heart rate monitor really drives me to go hard in my workouts. LOVE this. And sleep tracking is very helpful. It really does make all the difference for recovery and feeling at my best. I didn't want Alexa or too many features. This is a great deal and does everything I wanted.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Overview,"As a person who can use reminders, and appreciates the accountability of data- I really like the Fitbit to help keep me on track. I like how you can also tailor your own goals. The fun little accomplishment messages, and fun facts about the ground you have covered are also cool. I would say this- plan on replacing the band. The one it comes with, I found pretty uncomfortable. There are a lot of Fitbit and generic options out there at decent prices. Overall good, interactive, enjoyable product. Would buy again."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Pinch to activate = be prepared to be annoyed,I like how it measures heart rate. That's the only advantage it has over my regular Inspire. This pinch the device to activate it nonsense? REAL brilliant considering this device is worn at a joint on the body. I'm surprised the battery lasts as long as it does with how much it vibrates to let me know I've bent my hand at the wrist.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Pretty Good Sleep Data,"I have been very happy with this purchase. I don't feel the need to get new gadgets just because they're updated and was reluctant to switch away from my flex 2 (even though it was old enough to have charging issues).  The update in the sleep tracking system has made me very glad I did. It is nice to have the more detailed information about my phases of sleep. I was skeptical years ago when Fitbit first started advertising that they could do this, but seeing my data, I believe that it is reasonably accurate. Not a replacement for sleep studies, but will get you a good estimate of what is going on while you're asleep."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very Satisfied Customer,I was gifted a fitbit back in 2015 and didn't like it. I bought a Garmin and loved it. My Garmin played out so I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try a fitbit again. I like how sleak it is and it fits my tiny wrist perfectly. I also like that it keeps up with everything accurately so I don't have to. Clearly this is an upgrade from the one I didn't like in 2015. I haven't used the sleep track because I don't like sleeping with a watch on my wrist. I'm a very satisfied customer. When this one plays out I would even consider buying an even more expensive one.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very good Fitness and Exercise watch,"Watch works very well with the mobile app.  The auto exercise detector in the watch detected my elliptical without any trouble. The app shows useful data and analysis for your exercise and other activities. The sleep tracking is interesting but I don't find it all that useful. The heart rate tracking varies somewhat, but is good enough to track the zone you want to be in while exercising. Overall I find the Inspire 2 to be very helpful in maintaining my physical fitness."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Stepping Out,I bought this for tracking my step and so far I haven’t used too many other feature. It has kept me on track for getting away from my computer for a little bit once an hour. I would highly recommend a scratch guard for the face. I had mine scratched the morning the scratch guards arrive.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love all the tracking,"It's mostly accurate.

I love the free year membership and have taken advantage of all of the fitness suggestions. It's really motivated me to get moving."

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great product for a great price,"I love this Fitbit and I am still finding more functions every day that I wasn’t even aware it could do . Battery life so far has been as described. The charging cord is very short , but I was able to buy a compatible 2 pk for a really good price. The cords are much longer. Only other complaint is the sleep tracker has been not registering my sleep on occasion, especially on nights I feel I slept the best 🥴 maybe I’m doing something wrong, or sleeping so soundly it doesn’t sense I’m alive , lol Highly recommend this one . It fits my needs perfectly, although I know there are much fancier versions out there that does quite a bit more ."

I was skeptic that as the previous reviews have written that watch will vibrate a lot but haven’t faced that problem at all whatsoever.The battery life seems excellent and if somebody doesn’t like to carry the weight of a smart bulky watch this is perfect, this is perfect to look at time and your health stats and also have simple text and call notifications sent to watch."

If you are looking to track your steps, heart rate, and sleep this is perfect. I turned off notifications so it is just simply that for me. Don’t get me wrong, it can do much more. I did not want this to turn into another distracting device. You can get many cute bands to wear, as well"

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great solution to track health,"The tracker is easy to use and set up. The step counter and sleep tracking are accurate. There are lots of features on the mobile app and I’ve only used a few of them so far, but I really liked the sleep tracking feature. The display got scuffed after  two weeks of active use but it doesn’t bother me too much. I had a weird glitch where the heart rate monitor turned itself off and I couldn’t find the feature to turn it back on, but I just disconnected the device from my phone and reconnected, and that fixed it. This is a really nice device if you want heart rate, step counting, and sleep tracking."

LOVE the app - the first few days I felt like I was discovering something new every day! I have the premium subscription which is TOTALLY worth the money. I’ve lost 8 lbs in 2 weeks just by following some classes from the app, tracking my steps and trying to hit a higher step count, and being more conscious of what I eat."

It also gives you a sleeping score each day to improve your sleeping habits. So glad I purchased this."

The sleep tracking is amazingly helpful and love the integration with Noom.  I also love the competitive games with Fit it app to keep me motivated on step goals and sleep goals.  The vibration reminders on the watch (silent alarm) reminding me to drink water or move around based on my daily strategy is so easy to setup and actually works because it is silent and not popping up as a calendar reminder or where other people can see.

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",The most important feature of the Aspire 2 is the heart rate monitor.,"My wife upgraded to the Aspire 2 and I got her hand me down Flex on 5/4. Less than two weeks later I ordered an Aspire 2 for myself.  In the last week I wore the Flex I walked 4.2 miles per day and in the 3 days so far with the Aspire 2 I have have averaged 5 miles.  In the year before I got the Flex, (the year of covid), I doubt I walked for ten consecutive minutes even once or even gave it any thought.  I find the information about my efforts to be a powerful motivation to do more.  To me the most important feature of the Aspire 2 is the heart rate monitor."

5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great first Fitbit,I absolutely love this!!! First time Fitbit user here. I’ll be honest at times when I’m typing it might pick up a few steps here and there that I don’t make but it also underestimates by a few sometimes so I’ve done multiple experiments actually counting my steps and watching the tracker and it really overall comes out to a great estimate for steps in my opinion. I love the sleep tracker also!!And the battery is amazing. I’ve charged this 3 times since January 6th and usually only while I’m showering.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Works as expected. No complaints.,"Works as expected.  App is reliable so far. Like the heart rate and sleep tracker. Also i have not noticed it buazzing a lot, which other refusers have said. It buzzes lightly as a reminder to keep moving when getting close to goals and then again when you meet your overall steps goal for the day. Prefer the smaller size to some of the other fitbits. Holds a charge well. Good purchase so far."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Enjoying my new Fitbit!,"I just got my Inspire 2 Fitbit because I want an all-in-one-place way to track my progress and keep an eye out for anything off in my busy lifestyle. I can easily check my progress on my watch, and, if I want a more comprehensive look at my data, I can find it on the app.Since this is my first Fitbit I checked out some reviews before purchasing my Inspire 2. Now, I'm a little confused. Unless Fitbit fixed the syncing issue(s) I heard about before I got mine, I'm not sure what syncing issues some people are reporting because my Fitbit works just fine with my app."
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Love it so much,"Previously, I had a fitness tracker under an unknown brand. I bought it because it was cheap, but I didn't like it at all. Fitbit Inspire 2 was my first fitness tracker under a well-known brand, and wow, it far exceeded my expectation. I love it so much! The design, the function, the app, everything. I wear it almost everyday to track my steps, heart rate, and sleep. I also use it to track my gym workout and swimming sessions. Now that Fitbit is bought by Google, I hope it will be even easier to integrate our fitness data to our other personal information."

My journey with Fitbit started with my Alta and after having in for a few years went to the Inspire HR.  Within the warranty period it stopped holding a charge.

Plus you get all your phone notifications. Overall it is much better that Apple Watch in terms of health tracking.
5.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Great encouragement.,I brought my Fitbit first assistance in my weight loss. The mobile app is easy to use and I like using the food log for accountability.  The sleep tracker is just a score. Mine is always fair with no information on how to improve.  I have tested the accuracy several times and it is spot on. I would love a blood pressure and oxygen function but didn't like the size of the upgrade and I didn't need it to sync my cell calls. I have lost 70 lbs and can honestly say the fitbit has been a big encouragement.
