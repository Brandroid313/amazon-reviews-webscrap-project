1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Headache From Hell,"Almost 10 years ago, this was my FAVORITE perfume. Everytime I hear Vera Wang I think of it. This doesnt go to say that this happened because its a knock off (because from what I remember of it, it looks 100% legit) it could just be that senses change as you get older but this stuff gave me the WORST headache. So bad I felt like I couldnt get away from the smell and almost vomited. On one wrist, it smelled ok.. on the other it smelled like old lady perfume. I gave it to a co worker and I wont be surprised if she throws it away too. It is just not for me, which sucks because I was really looking forward to it. My advice for online ordering of perfume, unless you know exactly what you like and can order it from a reputable website, dont. Just go into the store and test out some and make sure you like it so you dont waste your money."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Horrible,"This perfume arrived yesterday. It smells like pure alcohol! Very cheap smelling, does not smell nice like the original.  Very strong. Beware. Wasted 24.00, now I'll have to go IN store and re-purchase."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Fake? Should have went to my local Kohls to purchase instead.,"Extremely floral scent. You look at the beautiful packaging and you think it's going to be a playful, youthful scent.  In Vera Wang style I expected some refinement of floral tones but this just smelled like old lady Avon perfume. Went to local Kohls and it didn't smell anything like this stuff. Amazon isn't a reliable source for quality anymore. In fact I don't think they have any quality control what so ever... I highly suggest as consumers we start investing in our local stores again that hire local workers and pay local taxes."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Does not smell like the real thing.,"About three weeks ago, I tried this scent on in a department store.  Loved it so I decided to try finding it cheaper on Amazon.  Reviews were mixed but with an average of over four stars, I thought it was worth a shot.Wrong.  Wrong. Wrong.This smells NOTHING like what I tried on in-store.  This product smells like baby powder.  I can't stand the smell.Cheap. Gross. Knockoff.Buyer beware."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Smelled Off,"Unfortunately I couldn't use this perfume for more than a day without getting a migraine.The box smelled like odd chemicals but I thought it was just the packaging, since I've worn this specific brand of perfume and I've loved it for so long.When I put it on- it smelled funny, but I thought I could at least give it a day- but by my lunch break I had to run home and take a shower.It's a shame because I truly do love this perfume, just not from this supplier."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Fake,"Bought this based on good reviews (4.6 stars). However, I should have listened to the 1-star reviews (only 4%)! I thought: well, maybe they just got the bad batch ... But no they were on target. This smells like alcohol. Clearly it's a fake. Buyer Beware: There is no return for this product."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce","Longevity Zip, beautiful package, pleasant fragrance, worthless product.","It is obvious Vera Wang put the money in the glass bottle and packaging because there is zero longevity.  The scent is pleasant, but fades as soon as it dries. I don't understand why there is a metal crown and ring on the bottle because there is no functionality, it leaves you scratching your head and asking WHY? If Eau de Toilett means weak fading scent, they nailed IT. Reminds me of Avon."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Dont waste your money on this product.,"Horrible product,  this so called ""scent"" smells like talcum powder from the early 1900's.Good thing the ""scent"" doesn't last every long.  Im not convinced this is the real Vera Wang Princess parfume, not at all."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce","Do not buy, not as described.","Not as described at all.

Initially contacted seller who said theyâ€™d email me a return label and never did."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce","Smells like old, musty baby power","DO NOT BE DUPED!!! Smells like old, musty baby power! YUCK! This can't be real!

1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Don't stay longer- waste of money- do not buy.,"I had purchasedit for my wife to see the high rating review and get fooled. The smell dont last long. The longevityis very very poor. I wish i could return  it, but the worst part is its not eligible for return. Total waste of money. I could have bought Victoria'sSecret with this money. So DO NOT BUY. Save your money. DO NOT BUY.."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Smells horrible!!!,"I can't believe that this is a vera Wang product. I was so excited to be receiving it. Unfortunately it smells horrible and I couldn't even wash the smell off, it had to wear off several hours later. Do not buy this unless you like smelling like your repelling mosquitoes. FAKE!!! Also, it's not returnable so you are out the money and and you smell bad. It's a loose loose situation."
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Smells like a fake.,This is the complete truth. I did a test by ordering this because of the reviews. Sure enough!!! It smells like generic 409 cleaner. This is definitely fake. The bottle is pretty.

When I went to cancel it(within 10 mins) it didnâ€™t let me. Nor it didnâ€™t let me return it because the perfume is not authentic.
1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",don't waste your money!!,"I rarely review anything but since I am someone who does actually read reviews- I wish I listed to all the ""buyer beware"" and ""DO NOT BUY"" reviews.  I had previously purchased this perfume in a department store and loved it.  This product is no where even close to the real thing.  Smells terrible/like alcohol and doesn't last more than a minute on.  I was bummed.  Can't find it in the department stores now but still looking for the real deal.  This is fake/old/or something, but it's not Vera Wang Princess whatsoever."

When I put this on, it smelled like nothing more than baby powder in liquid form mixed in with a faint fruit scent. I figured maybe it's just my body chemistry, so I sprayed it onto a tester strip and waited. Same thing. To make matters worse, the scent didn't even last for more than 10 minutes!

1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",It's a Scam,"This review for the specific bottle of Princess I bought on Amazon from Trendsetters, not the perfume in general. I've purchased 2 bottles of Princess from the department store and I love it. I found it on Amazon for half what I pay at Macy's and thought it was worth a shot. The perfume itself should be pink in color; the bottle I received contained a clear liquid with a slight bit of pink (only if you hold it to the light). When I sprayed it, it had no scent whatsoever. Nothing. The nozzle on the perfume bottle smelled sort of like black pepper. Basically, its not perfume, its just water and food coloring. I wanted to return it, but perfume is on the list of non-returnable items because its a flammable material. I filed a claim with Amazon and contacted the seller in hopes I can get a refund. Don't waste your money and don't buy anything from Trendsetters; they're only here to cheat you. I assume most of these positive reviews are from people who work for Trendsetters."

I did not like it at all.  I thought maybe it was me, so I just let it sit.  The other day I came across it in the store again and decided to smell the tester.  I was DEFINITELY hoodwinked.  The perfume in the store instantly reminded me of the scent I loved.  Will not reorder from this seller."

Yes I ordered this from the AMAZON WAREHOUSE, SHIPPED FROM AMAZON! OMG, I am so happy that I did not give this as a gift, like I had originally intended to! I would be mortified! The reason I opened it up in the first place was, the two pieces of the top(plastic crown and plastic ring from a gumball dispenser) were loose in the package Amazon MAILED IT TO ME IN! SO I THOUGHT, THAT CANT BE THE vera Wang princess I ordered from Amazon! I thought it was broken glass, the way it sounded! Honestly, I'm surprised the bottle didn't break, with those clanking pieces and the way it was packaged! I have never had a problem with Amazon EVER, UNTIL NOW.... AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE COOL WATER IS JUST THE SAME-FAKE. IF YOU LOOK ON THE BACK OF THE BOX, It says (under vera wang-with a little TM beside her name-the nerve) but it says Coty, then some Paris address, but THEN IT CONTINUES TO SAY, ""Coty UK&I, Kent, TN25 4AQ."". YES YALL! IT SAYS LITERALLY IN FINE PRINT KENT, TENNESSEE!!! IVE NEVER IN ALL MY DAYS! AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE COOLWATER I BOUGHT from the AMAZON WAREHOUSE AND YET AGAIN SHIPPED FROM AMAZON, SAYS THAT NAME ""COTY"" ON THE BOX TOO!! NOW YOU TELLING ME THAT VERA WANG AND DAVIDOFF ARE NOW SELLING THEIR AMAZING DESIGNER FRAGRANCES TOGETHER, AT THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT, THEY TEAMED UP TO SELL THE FRAGRANCES TOGETHER OUT OF SOME PLACE IN TN?!?

1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Anyone else notice the almost complete lack of scent?,"I was unhappily surprised by this EDT and it's lack of scent let alone the ability to maintain scent.  I've tried this on and purchased at department stores and while I've also bought the perfume version, I would have expected SOME stronger initial scent from this EDT. Truly, I don't know what happened or why but I feel like I have a $23.00 bottle of lilac colored water in a really pretty bottle. It came packaged like others I've purchased but it was most definitely NOT the same VW Princess I've used in the past.  I was actually surprised by the inexpensive price for this on Amazon when I saw it and thought I was getting a REALLY great deal for one of my favorites. Not so. Oddly, I'd also purchased some Vanilla Fields on Amazon too a few weeks before this and while the product liquid itself was darkly discolored (a sign of heat exposure and/or aged product), it did have a normal scent and a lingering that was entirely expected. I would NOT recommend and will not be buying again."

It has a beautiful smell and is very long lasting. When I openedthis bottle that I purchased it smells fine going on but there is no lasting of the fragrance. It is gone before an hour is up. I will NEVERpurchase fragrance products on Amazon again.

Its a watered down version with very weak smell and very light pink in color. Not satisfied at all. Received it 5 days back and tried returning it today but it seems its not eligible for return either since it requires special transportation and handling which seller canâ€™t provide . $33.20 gone down the drain :(

1.0,"Vera Wang Princess Eau de Toilette Spray for Women, 3.4 Fl Ounce",Probably counterfeit,"When I received this perfume, the seal was broken. I sprayed one pump on myself and it smelled awful. Like rubbing alcohol, BO, and potpourri. I've never smelled this perfume before, but I doubt such a popular scent would smell so terrible. Amazon is having a lot of problems with counterfeit products right now. Once I pick up this perfume from an official retailer, I will update my review."

This product appears completely different than the quality of my other Princess products -- see the color, fragrance (this one smells strongly of alcohol for a while), and bottle quality (the ring/crown metal).I would return this product in a heartbeat.
