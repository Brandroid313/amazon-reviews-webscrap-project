1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Buzzes too much :/,"Pros:-HR seems very accurate-I love almost all the new features-Syncs well with iOS 14-Picks up on a lot of stuff and is very accurate-Comfy and looks nice, isn’t too bigCons:-Every time I move my hand back (pic above) it buzzes and turns on and off and it’s ANNOYING!! And it messes with features, such as; the timer when I’m running, going back to the Home Screen, and going to the settings. And it does that in my sleep.-So the way to fix this is to wear it higher on my wrist/forearm... but that’s not as comfortable.-I’ve only had it for a day and I want to try it out for at least a week... but that’s just a dumb feature. I’d rather just tap the top to turn it on than press the sides. Who came up with that?- I don’t like that I run for 30 minutes but it changes it to a higher number because “active zone” or whatever gives you 2x the minutes. If I run for 30 minutes... I run for 30 minutes! It says I exercised for 99 minutes... but I only did 69 minutes. It gave me 2x the minutes. That’s just dumb and confusing.- I also don’t like that I can’t zoom in on my sleeping log and see the graph.Update: I’m returning it"
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","If you're looking for a minimalist activity tracker and heart rate monitor, this isn't it","I chose the Inspire 2 because it was the bottom of the line fitbit product. I wanted the least fancy, least capable device.  All I want is time, steps and heartrate.  This device is chummed full of other features and the user interface sucks.  It takes no fewer than 6 separate taps or swipes to get to a screen displaying my heart rate.  Apparently, there's not a way to display heart rate on the home screen. The library of clock faces listed in the fitbit app include some with heartrate - none of them available for the Inspire 2. (see photo) Furthermore, the font size of the display is too tiny to read when in motion. Updating the device software requires keeping your phone nearby and open to the fitbit app for 30 minutes. (more evidence in support of the ""user interface sucks"" comment). No directions come with the device. Help.fitbit.com is vague, poorly written and no help.  Instead of a minimalist, functional device, the Inspire 2 tries to do everything and does it all poorly."

However, now I'm being told by Fitbit support that I am ineligible because I used a 1-month Premium trial more than a year ago with my Inspire HR. Thus, I no longer count as a ""new Premium customer"", despite never having paid for Premium.Dear FitBit team, please share this information with people BEFORE they buy your hardware. I will return the device as a matter of principle, because I'm not supporting deceptive marketing practices.I hope others do the same. We shouldn't let them get away with this.EDIT: I finally returned the device after Fitbit has not addressed my concerns for >2 months. I’m still waiting for a response from their specialist team ..."
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",It works so intermittently it feels like an untested release,"I've had two other Fitbits, the Flex 2 and the Versa. The Flex 2 was amazing. It doesn't have a digital face, it's just the ""bean"" sitting inside the wrist holder. It tracked my steps perfectly and it never failed to give a vibration notification for a text. One of my favorite parts of having a Fitbit is the silent vibration notifications, I much prefer that to having an audible ding or tone that disrupts the environment. Plus in a professional setting knowing you'll not be interrupted ever brings peace of mind. I moved to the Versa thinking it would be nice to have the time and other functions on the wrist again. It worked great, tracked the steps at the same tempo, all notifications came through, and it never froze in the water lock state. I just didn't like having a full watch after having the slim line Flex 2 for 2+ years so I looked at this Inspire 2. It's only a smidge bigger than the Flex 2 was in it's band, so it gets some points there. That's where the points end tho. It fails on notifications intermittently. Sometimes a text will vibrate through, and sometimes it doesn't. There's no rhyme or reason as to why it just stops. I've tried force closing and resyncing the app, restarting my phone, nothing makes it better it just decides to work again at some point. I've had nothing but trouble getting it off of water lock mode. Which is a must when showering or it'll freak out and start hopping menus and such. Sometimes a couple of good taps and the menu to un-water lock pops up, sometimes you have to tap it 20+ times and still nothing. Then in a few minutes it turns its own screen on and works again. The raise to wake function I keep turning off but it keeps defaulting to back on. The sensors on the side are intermittent whether or not they'll activate the screen on touch. It gives haptic feedback when it works and sometimes it's just plain dead. Sometimes it won't sync to the app so I'll shut the app down and re-sync. The steps are MUCH different than the other two which I wore for over 3 years so I have a really good idea of what a normal day looks like for me. At best it seems to track sluggishly, the numbers are way under. The band it comes with doesn't sit on the wrist correctly, and lots of folks have mentioned it giving them rashes. All in all this is only my third experience with Fitbit, I'll try one more probably as I lost the Flex 2 and the Versa I sold to pay for this one, but if this is indicative of their products outside of a bare bones Flex or a flagship Versa then I may not bother wearing one any more. I hardly ever win the step competitions anyway! Both the other Fitbits I turned on and they worked close to 100% of the time with no issue, this one is maybe 50% of the time with lots of fenagling and effort. Not worth the cost."
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Terrible product if you just want a wrist based heart rate monitor and not wrist based spyware.,"All I wanted was a reliable watch that tells me my heart rate. This highly invasive device doesn't work out of the box, requires a cell phone (the Windows software doesn't work, and is still flashing a message about not finding an internet connection, even as I write this and stream videos.) I want one very simple thing: to make sure my heart rate doesn't go too high without having to carry a fingertip pulse oximeter around with me. This device refuse to let me do this basic task without information overshare and buying a tablet or iPhone that supports its app to get the watch past its initial setup screen. I should not have to login to use a watch. I will never buy a fitbit product again."
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Awful,"This was horrible. Im so disappointed since I've been buying fitbits for 8 years now...Physical design: its bulky and sits away from your wrist. It put pressure on my wrist in a way that made my hand tingle unless I wore it VERY loose. So loose that the HR tracking didn't work. The slim ""against the skin"" feel of the Alta was WAY better. This one is cumbersome and in the way. Its just terrible. The new locking mechanism is horrid too. Flimsy and easy shaken loose.Touchscreen design: awful. Just terrible. Every movement causes it to vibrate! The buttons on the side to ""activate"" one of the menus is constantly being pressed by simple arm movements. And then this causes it to vibrate. WHICH YOU CAN STILL NOT TURN OFF.FITBIT, GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULLS THAT WE WANT THE OPTION TO TURN OFF VIBRATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING YEARS.So I went to make myself a pita pocket and in that simple process it went to the ""menu"" and triple buzzed 14 times! This also meant that when I flicked my wrist to check the time... the menu was up, not the time. This was the deal breaker for me, as I work with kids and use a lot of arm movements.(The picture I attached is NOT the Inspire 2. I am already in the process of getting a refund. It is my old Alta. But THIS is how little you could bend your arm and the menu would start spazzing out and vibrating like crazy every 2-5 seconds. That simple bend was enough to make it think you were pinching the sides and activing a menu.)How was this thing green lit in any trials? I imagine if you are someone who works out you will slightly bend your wrist every few seconds doing something or other... so you want your health tracker vibrating and messing up all of your settings every time you lift? Seems like poor design skills to me.I'm sure this one functionally does fine, most fitbits work fine, but I am not keeping it long enough to test out the new battery life, how well HR monitor works, etc... The basic design flaw are enough to send me running.Fitbit: You guys really missed the mark considering if you had just taken the Alta design and made it touchscreen with a longer battery life your would be rolling in $. You could have kept the casing prints, saved tons of money on the airhead designers you obviously got for this round, and done so much better.Trust me, I like your app, I like the idea of your fitness trackers, but you all SUCK at design."

Went to put it on for the very first time and and it ripped."
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Pay attention to the reviews before buying,"I really wanted to like the Inspire 2--most of the reviews were telling me to run away, fast. I should have paid attention.When I got the Inspire 2 out of the package, it was already at 1,765 steps. Which I figured out was probably from all the tumbling around in the box as it was being shipped and moved around.  I tried to reset it, but I could not figure it out, so I waited until the next day for it to reset the step counter.  I set up a sleep schedule and it was a perfect product for at least two days. It did everything I wanted it to do and more. The Premium subscription is amazing. They really thought of everything.  Mediation videos, food videos, so many videos, that are short and to the point. There are many groups to join too. So many different groups, people to cheer on and vice versa, and you can add friends from all over the world, and join their team for the week to pick up your step count. Everyone was so friendly and accommodating, and absolutely no trolling—so nice to be a part of a community of people who are all nice to one another cheering you on your goals.However, there is a problem with the one-year free subscription that comes with the Inspire 2.  There is not a selection to choose it on the Fitbit app. The choices I was given were a monthly subscription at $9.99, a Premium+Coaching (where you can get a personal coach to assist you on your health goals) for $54.99 for one month, or a Fitbit Premium Annual (1 year) for $79.99 –that frankly, all that they offer, it is an amazing deal. I would have totally paid for it after my free year just to keep all the extras they offer—but there was no option for a free year. So what is a girl to do?  I selected the only option available, three months free at which point it stated that my one year PAID subscription would begin on May 6.  I immediately contacted support and I was told to cancel the subscription and within 1-3 days, when I re-enrolled in the Premium subscription the one-year free would be there. But it wasn’t there, so I contacted support again, at which point I was told that I did not cancel it and I was told to do it again, only thing was there was no option to cancel it because it was already cancelled—which I told the support person. Then I was told that it was an “Apple” problem.  According to Apple, it was a Fitbit problem.  I am not going to be a rat in a maze trying to find the door, which is how I was feeling at this point.That was just one of the problems, there were others—like the DND light coming on at night every time I moved (which according to the Fitbit community is a common glitch that cannot be fixed), or the Fitbit not syncing “all of a sudden” (which is another glitch according to the Fitbit community), or every time my wrist tapped the desk, or the key board, or anything for that matter, the Inspire 2 would buzz consistently and sometimes when I wasn't moving at all--it would buzz even with notifications turned off (which was very annoying—and which I could not find a fix for). Some of the good...I loved the food, water and exercise logs. They were so easy to use and had many food choices--loved the scan barcode feature too. I love that I can choose my own ""face"" for when it shows the time, like a cat, or a dog, and there are other choices. But, with all of the downsides though, there is not enough good plus sides for me to keep it, even at the discounted price, so I'm returning it."
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Inspire 2 has defects,"Bought and returned two separate Inspire 2’s over past month. First one kept inadvertently going into Do Not Disturb (DND) mode. Was told by FitBit customer service that I had a faulty device and could exchange. Did so, but also noted multiple complaints about same issue from others. Clearly a design fault. Tried replacement device just in case and it has the same issue. I was missing calls and texts randomly and spending too much time troubleshooting. Spent some time on the phone with FitBit support again and was told they were aware of the issue and would email me for resolution (different dept?). That was a week ago...no email. So I’m sending second one back and reverting to my old Alta HR because even with a cracked screen, it’s more reliable than the Inspire 2. Disappointed in the product and customer service."

No written instructions included.  What they call instruction book includes 5 pages safety and battery information.  ""Instructions"" doesn't even include how to turn the thing on/off.  The rest of the hundred pay page booklet seems to have real instructions, but NONE in English.  Had to call support to try and sync it to the app and they were unable to help.  Thought I was safe with purchasing the middle price point product.  But obviously not.  Too afraid to purchase another Fitbit as the problem seems to be with connecting the devices to the app.  No use having it if you don't have the app.  I returned it and will be purchasing a different brand"

I am comparing steps from my iPhone Health, under the assumption that my iPhone step counter is correct.Right now, I have registered 2,226 steps on the Fitbit app. I wear it on my left (non-dominant hand).

1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)","Many many reboots, resets, and way too ""glitchy.""","Edit;I used to love it - but its now too glitchy. Company keeps giving different excuses.  I've had to reset it, and uninstall, and reinstall wayvtoo many times. First time, it stopped tracking my heart rate. I had to do a complete reset. Then it suddenly stopped recognizing my walks this week, though it saw the steps. The ""Community"" response from Fitbit when this happens was to reset it at least 3 times in  row. This seems a somewhat common problem from what I can tell. It happened again today...didn't see a 30 minute walk so had to be manually entered. I just reset it a day ago.Edit: Downgraded it again. It wasn't recognizing exercise again. So I called the company. The first words I uttered is,"" This has been happening a lot, and I've done resets, data clears, reboots - and it works well for a while, then goes back to the same problem. They guided me through another factory reset, reboot, app removal and reinstall (which I'd also done before) - which I'd told the Rep I'd already done several times. They claimed it was a ""software problem,"" even when I told the representative at one point that the watch was refusing to scroll while he was  guiding me through another data clear.I asked at what point they'd replace it - so then the Rep tried claiming that I had never reset it before. I had made it clear I had at the onset of the conversation. At the beginning of the conversation I also asked for someone in the U.S. - as I didn't want any misunderstandings. He told me he could transfer me, but couldn't promise it would be someone in the U.S. The whole conversation was a circus at trying to avoid the question I kept asking - ""At what point will the watch be replaced?"" No answer.Nice idea. Really bad implementation and a company who won't own the problems."

First day, it's going back for two reasons.1) Step count is terrible. It can't even count 30 steps properly, let alone a long walk. AND I saw the number at 198. A few seconds later, it had gone down to 169. My step count WENT DOWN, not up. What??? Step count is one of the three things I care about my watch tracking (heart rate, step count, and sleep is all I really care about on an activity tracker), so this is unacceptable.2) The ""white"" is not white. I wanted a white wristband, but this one is a grayish white, definitely not white. Even just from the color, pulling it out of the box, I knew I would have to either return the watch or buy a whole new wristband, which I wasn't planning on."

1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",It Simply Doesn't Work,"I bought this item in December 2020 to help me keep an eye on my heart rate so I could make sure that I stayed at the right percentage while doing cardio.For the first few weeks, the product worked great. I checked my heart rate manually and verified that the rate displayed was accurate (both at rest and during exercise). Having something track the number of minutes I had spent in ""active"" mode was a nice incentive and kept me motivated to get my cardio in each day.A few months ago, I noticed that the readings seemed to be off, especially when I would get my heart rate above 120 or 125 BPM. I would check my heart rate manually (10 seconds, multiplied by 6) and calculate a heart rate in the 140s or 150s, but the FitBit would show my heart rate being around 100. As time went on, the discrepancy got worse; I'd be in the 150s or 160s and the FitBit would show a heart rate in the mid-80s. Even the built-in heart rate monitor on the gym equipment was more accurate.I've tried every solution that the manufacturer recommends (cleaning the underside of the bit, adjusting the tightness, moving the bit an inch or two up my arm, switching to my other wrist and updating the dominant/non-dominant setting in the app, factory reset), but nothing has resolved the problem.I foolishly threw the box and packaging away, so returning the product isn't an option. Today I've finally decided to just stop wearing it, since at this point it does nothing for me except for give sweat a place to collect. I can't bring myself to throw something that cost $70 in the trash, so I'll probably just throw it in a sock drawer and try to forget that I ever wasted money on it.The product promises to collect all sorts of data to help users improve their health, but if it isn't collecting data accurately, how reliable can any of its suggestions be? These inaccuracies were only when I was actively monitoring and verifying its readings; what about all the time that I'm not checking?I regret my purchase and encourage others to avoid repeating my mistake. But if you do want to try your luck, definitely hold on to the box for at least a year. If your experience is like mine, you'll be needing it."

I tried moving it around but as the week went on the pain got more noticeable, plus I'd have redness in that spot, too.  I looked into it and if you get a rash or notice pain you're supposed to discontinue use; apparently some people are sensitive to the EMF from the bluetooth and can't use it, and I was one.

What the Fitbit (or Amazon) website does not tell you is that if you buy the device for a child less than 13, you cannot set it up. The Fitbit app requires that you put in a birthdate. If it shows you are less than 13, you have to have a parent set up a family plan. Once you set up the family plan, it restricts children to the ACE devices for kids. So, if you bought this device, you cannot set it up. Nowhere on the Fitbit website is this disclosed. Amazon does not carry the disclaimer (no blame to Amazon).

So when it stopped working I ordered an Inspire 2 to replace it. BIG MISTAKE.  No matter what I did I could not get the Notifications to work. The Fitbit would not vibrate when I received a call or a text. I called the Helpline twice and spent hours on the phone to get it resolved but it never worked. Customer service was terrible! The first person I spoke to was nasty and rude. The second person was polite but couldn't fix the problem. She said she was sending the case to a special unit and they would respond to me on email with a way to fix the problem. I never heard from them. This is an inferior product. Do not order it.

I am returning this one.I was interested in upgrading my Alta and thought this would be a great time to do it... Prime Day sale! It came quickly and appears to already be charged. Hurray, I thought. I also purchased a different band as I do not like the feeling of rubber against my skin. I also am very sensitive to thing being tight around my wrist. The replacement band is metal with a magnet clasp so it can adjust to literally any/every size. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to get this band off. What a horrible design! There is a little metal pin that needs to be pushed to one side to slide the band off, UGH! Who thought this was a good idea? The pin can easily fall out of the slot of the band and without it you can't reattach the thing. When I tried to attach the metal replacement band I got, it wouldn’t stay attached to the Fitbit so I tried to get the rubber one back on. No luck. I struggled with the thing for about 10 minutes before I packaged it back up and printed my return label. I change out my bands regularly and am not about to go through this pain every time I want a different look.Also, with every new Fitbit a new charger needs to be purchased. Yes, it does come with one charger with a super short cord. I tend to misplace chargers if I have to move them from one location to another. I like to have one in the charging area, one in my car and one in my office.I would NOT recommend this Fitbit to anyone I liked."

It’s impossible to put on the straps or put the watch on your wrist or on the charger without holding each side of the watch face. Which sets off incessant buzzing changing settings on the watch which you then have to fix. Dumbest. Design. Ever!! Also, I put on before bed for the first time after setting it up. Woke up around 3:30 am to nurse the baby and my watch falls off because the pins holding the strap in have already come loose. It isn’t looking good for this product so far. I miss my inspire HR.Day 2: I despise this thing. Who the heck wants to have to turn on water lock every time they get in water? I briefly submerged my wrist while bathing my child and it starts buzzing at me and changing settings just from the warmth of the water. The water lock is a giant pain in the neck to turn on and off and I hate it."
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Totally inaccurate…either a defective unit or a defective design,"Abysmal accuracy. Pulse meter off by 25-33% and wanders randomly during my workout.  My actual pulse was between 138 and 150. The watch showed 99 to 112.  One time, it showed what appeared to be an accurate reading of 138.  As a result, the app shows I was in fat burn mode nearly the entire time when I was actually in cardio for almost all of the time.This watch is as accurate as the cheap Chinese knockoff I bought on eBay for $6.00…which is, not at all. I’m gonna order a replacement and see if that makes a difference. If it does, I’ll update accordingly; if the replacement is as accurate as the  original, I will post that, as well.Follow-up as promised:Got my replacement  watch today, charged up, loaded software updates, synced to my iPhone, got on the stepper, and the same problem. I’m measuring my carotid pulse at 138 and the watch showed 99. It would typically float around 100-105. The discrepancies were consistent and the heart rate values were completely random. In addition, it took multiple taps on the screen for it to turn on. Another distraction.I have an Apple Watch that I wear exactly the same way and it’s pulse meter is consistently spot on.I do not understand why this device doesn’t work, and I’m not happy with it. It, too, is going back…this time, for a refund.My suggestion: pay the premium and go with the Apple Watch. It’s a far  better product…accurate, easy to read, and tons of apps."

I would wake up with over 500 steps, have over 4000 steps in a very inactive day, so naturally I contacted support. All they do is ask questions (some of them the same questions) then hand you to a ""specialist"" who tells you to do things that are clearly already done. Opened another support ticket and then boom, same dumb questions. All I wanted was a replacement for a defective item, but nope, more stupid questions.Sure maybe I got a bad item, but support is a pain in the a**, never buying a fitbit product again."

Got a replacement. Wouldn't sync but finally got past the intial part to have the Bluetooth part never complete. I have the charge 2 and put this on the same hand and it never wakes when you turn it. It took 5 tries to get it once. The charge 2 worked every time. To make matters worse if you can get it to sync the clock faces and settings suck. You can not custom at all. You can not set the order of thing when scrolling through or on the clock face. The options are not good either. We tried 2 different ones, it wasn't just a bad one! Do not buy.

The major issues were the inability of the watch and app to communicate.  I deleted and reloaded the app 3 times per instructions and none of the suggestions I received from support worked.  Initially I thought the app was FUBAR, but in hindsight I think it's the watch.  Some of the issues are listed below.....Watch consistently recorded me in light sleep when I had insomnia and was awake.  It's not possiable to edit the sleep data.I did a walk with google GPS and mapped it at 1.8 miles.  I did the same walk with fitbit (not using GPS) and it mapped it at 1.6 and 1.1 miles.  I understand when measuring steps isn't as accurate as GPS, but why the difference between 1.6 and 1.1 miles for an identical walk.  Because you can't edit ANY data provided by the device this means some data will be wildly inaccurate.I logged weight into the app daily and lost about 4 lbs in 5 days.  The app shows all the individual entries but shows ""- - lbs lost.""  I'm looking at the entries in the app and somehow it can't do simple math?Last night I used the start sleep function and ended it this morning for a session of about 6.5 hours in bed.  The first 1.5 hours I was awake and it logged me in light sleep, but the real issue is it shows that I had 14+ hours of sleep.I'm using this with  Samsung Galaxy S8+ so the phone is just a few years old and operates fine.  So I've wasted 5 hours in 5 days troubleshooting Fitbit issues for the company.  I can't imagine this is a normal experience or Fitbit would already be under.  It's a shame that this is my first experience with the company because it was soooo bad I may not give them another chance.Bad luck or horrible product??????????"

This new one is no match.The battery lasted about 10 days for the first 2 charges, but since then, it only lasts 2 days.  I don’t use most of the features and don’t activate the screen too often.  Also, you have the option to dim the screen, but if you do, you can hardly read it, especially outside.  Another thing I don’t like is how small the characters are.

However, my last 2 Fitbit watches had slowly died out. So I was hoping a new Inspire 2 with Premium service would get me back to getting sleep data.  It started OK, but now I can't get data.  It keeps telling me it could not get sufficient heart rate data. My watch band is so tight now that there is a grove in my wrist and going any tighter hurts my arm and I can't fall asleep.  I check the watch just before falling asleep and there is a heart reading.  I also check when I wake up and it shows a heart rate reading.  The fact that I and still alive for the past several weeks indicates that my heart has not stopped beating.  So something is wrong.  Can I get a replacement?  Sad and disappointed."

I will keep the replacement a few days,  but if it says I burn 500 calories in my sleep I will determine these are defective and go with another device.

1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Very Buggy - Needs More Work,Upon receipt I charged the device overnight for about 8 hours.  On the first day I experienced intermittent functionality.  It would work for an hour or two and then the screen will go blank for several hours during which time I could not retrieve the display.  The display would magically come back on hours later without prompting and then disappear again for several hours.  I sat it on a desk during the second night.  The next morning it showed that I took over 1400 steps. I either got a bad one or this design needs to back to Development and Research for some tweaking.
1.0,"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Fitbit Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Don't bother,"Don't bother with the Inspire 2. It has a flaw in design that FitBit isn't interested in correcting. They got rid of the button on the left side in favor of touch activation on both sides. Good, right? Except that now the menu activates every time you bend your hand/wrist. It only touches one side, but it opens the menu and selects options. It also opens to a menu setting for DND (do not disturb) and Sleep Mode and if you're not careful, activates them. This is doubly annoying as if you enter the menu the normal way, this screen is several taps in. FitBit's only solution to this? Wear it higher up on your arm. I would have to wear this 1/4 the way up my forearm for this to stop. Not worth it, don't bother. Get the original Inspire or a different model."

A week ago, while at work, the green light started spazzing out and the Fitbit kept buzzing non-stop, after about 30 seconds of this, it got to the point where she had to rip it off her wrist because it felt like “an exposed electrical wire was burning her skin.” After that, the Fitbit kept buzzing until the battery died and no longer works.

I’m was excited, and I don’t have the funds to buy an Apple Watch, so this was a little gift to myself. It lasted 6 months. 6 months in the heart rate tracker stopped working. I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to work out, know you’re working hard, and see your rate rate going as 80.  I’m smart enough to know my heart rate was above 80. So, I stupidly bought a new one in like June or so. My husbands Fitbit, same model, is now doing the same thing with the heart rate, so we’ve now wasted $230 ish on this brand, plus the multiple models we tried in the past. My advice? Don’t waste your time and money. I wish I could get my money back. This brand is all hype and marketing and no quality."

I had a earlier version of a Fitbit years ago and it doesn't seem like the technology has improved since. While working out on a tread mill and/or elliptical machine the Inspire would frequently not detect any heart rate.

I have spent so much time this morning trying to do this and it doesn’t work. Second of all you can’t just tap the screen to see anything. It constantly wants to go into water lock mode and is constantly vibrating on your wrist because of that. I highly recommend looking at another Fitbit like the charge.

It makes believe that it tracks other exercises, but it’s way to convoluted to make it worthwhile.The heart rate monitor is inconsistent and hard to access..In general, this is a pretty device, which is pretty worthless.

As I was already following that advice, I'm left with nothing to improve my sleep.  the heart rate tracking is even worse.  When I am exercising, the fitbit screen will only stay on for a second or less, so I turn it on, try to quickly scroll down five times to the heart rate, and it's off most times before I even get to scroll once.

Nicely they restricted it to only 8 reminders - they are probably planning to charge you in the future to set up more reminders.Also the first thing they told me was to do a Factory reset. Which is interesting because the Watch was not supposed to be used. Not sure at what point of the supply chain they take broken Watches and resell them as new ones, but Amazon should probably look into it.Stay of away from this piece of garbage.

While sprinting on the treadmill it told me my HR was 122, when the treadmill HR function told me it was 160 (which is what it normally is when I run). I also noticed it said my HR was 48 when I was doing the stairmaster (on speed 12 with sweat pouring down my face). It constantly tells me I burn 200ish calories from an hour long workout, when people of similar height and weight burned 500 for the same workout.I am very frustrated and it is too late to return as its been longer than 30 days. I will never buy a fitbit again."

I have returned  it and my account was credited. Rarely would it show the time. Rarely was there anything on the face. The app would show my steps sometimes.

However, the only thing on the screen that is readable is the time, and for that I have a watch.  The rest of the features are impossible to read, even with reading glasses.  I live in Europe and ordered this so that I could have it when I visited the states, which is now.  I want to return it but see that the return date is already expired...I'm stuck with a useless, expensive watch, not a fitbit.

It is incredibly annoying, every time you bend you wrist it is vibrating, often multiple times in under a second. I've had it for a few days and have not gotten used to it.I've searched around on the forums for a way to turn off the vibrations but the only solution they seem to have is ""wear it higher on your wrist"" which is uncomfortable. I don't understand why they don't at least have a setting to turn it off, just like they have settings to turn off screen wake.I do not recommend and will probably return mine."

The message window would light up showing 0 messages and I could not get the vibration to work when my Iphone would ring. The vibration is a very important to me because a lot of the times I cannot hear my phone. It seems that these Inspire 2 trackers are not compatible with IOS 14 and higher. I will be returning this unit because of so many feature failures. I wish they still made the flex 2.

Based on the number of times that it's vibrated and told me ""way to go!"" Or ""you're almost there!"" when I've been sitting at my desk and haven't gotten up in hours, I'd say this thing is worthless as a fitness tracker. I'm assuming it's picking up my wrist movements as I shuffle/sort paperwork and counting that as some sort of exercise. My old Fitbit never did that. Also, I keep accidentally turning on the Do Not Disturb function which is  annoying. Total waste of money as far as I'm concerned."

If accuracy is important to you, do not buy this device or any other fitbit. The ""heart rate monitor"" creates numbers out of thin air. Put it in your pocket, take it out, and it reads ""cardio."" Go for a run, and it either can't read a heart rate at all or reads 70 bpm. Absolute garbage. Alleged ""customer support"" is terrible. Even if they wanted to help, they are too poorly trained to manage it. This company wasn't always the joke it is today. It used to be an industry leader. Sadly, times have changed.

I loved the previous fitbits I have had, and have found them helpful in maintaining my weight.  In addition to the sync issue,  I saw the reviews that it was a pain that the buttons are on both sides and that it would keep locking the screen.  I thought it wouldn't be a big deal, it was probably the way other users were wearing.  However, it is an issue.  My husband had gotten the same one, and also has issues with the sync."

Had to do a bunch of work convincing customer service that it wasn't working only for them to tell me it would be a while before they contacted me to resolve the issue.

I missed the return day and don't know what to do with it. Considering throwing it out because I mostly wanted the HR tracking and that's not even accurate when I'm running or biking. The sleep tracking is ok if you are willing to wear it to bed but that's not what I bought it for and it's very uncomfortable to sleep with it on. Probably going to just buy an HR chest strap at this point. What a waste...
