5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Initial impressions: Blown away.,"WOW. That's my reaction to my first few hours with the Oculus Quest 2. I intend to update this review as I spend more time with the device, but here's my preliminary review:Setup: Super easy. Out of the box you have the headset, 2 controllers, a glasses spacer, and a charging cord & adapter. That's it. The controllers run on a single AA battery each, so you pull a little tab to turn those on then turn on the headset. The headset then walks you through setup and a quick update. You NEED to use the Oculus app on your phone at this point so if you don't have an Oculus app and account setup, you'll be prompted. I was up and running and updated in about 10 minutes, and the battery was at 59% out of the box.The final step of setup has you draw a ""guardian"" boundary around you, which is intended to keep you from knocking into furniture and obstructions in your room. It has an option for standing as well as sitting which is a really nice feature, as a big grid will pop up and block your view if you stray close to the line.And then you're off to VR experiences!Screen: The clarity is very impressive. I have only ever experienced PlayStation VR, but this is considerably better looking. Text is really crisp and colors look great. Everything looks clear and smooth. If it looks blurry to you, you may need to adjust the headset up/down/left/right on your face and try the 3 different lens spacing options to get the best clarity.Sound: The headset has speakers built into it, which sound surprisingly good. I played a few levels of Beat Saber and it actually wasn't bad. Kinda like watching a video on your phone's speakers... good enough, but not going to blow you away. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack which you'll want to use for the best sound quality and immersion.Fit/Comfort: The headset has a foam cushion that presses against your forehead and cheeks. It is relatively comfortable but not as good as the PlayStation VR version, particularly because the foam gets damp if you sweat, while the PSVR has more of a rubbery material that wipes off. The straps holding the headset on are fabric and velcro which I was worried about at first, but you can actually get a pretty solid fit after some adjusting. The only downside here is that it won't be as simple to switch back and forth between other players. The headset does start to weigh on your face after extended periods of time but that's the nature of the beast with VR.Gameplay/tracking: This device requires no external sensors and instead tracks the controllers with cameras and accelerometers/gyroscopes. I am very impressed by the tracking. Beat Saber is a good tracking test as it requires really quick movements all over in front of your body and it never lost tracking that I noticed.Controllers: If you're new to VR, you get a controller for each hand with a few buttons and a joystick. Like an advanced Wii-mote or an Xbox controller cut in half with a plastic ring on top. The button layout is intuitive and comfortable, everything is easily within reach. I'm actually a fan of these running on AA batteries as that means no downtime for charging as long as you have extras laying around. I had a few times I wanted to play PSVR and had to wait for controllers to charge.Overall: I believe this device is VR's best shot to become mainstream. You can use it anywhere (indoors), with no wires and no PC or PlayStation required. It just works. It is relatively affordable and the library of VR experiences is steadily growing and already includes some amazing options. I am excited to see what the next few years of VR is like now that developers have this high performance standalone device in their hands.Disclaimer: You NEED a Facebook account for this device. If you're not a fan of Facebook, you'll need to look elsewhere."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,1st,first
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Extremely impressive, especially for the price","I've owned and tested 15 different VR headsets for my Youtube channel and this is the second highest resolution I've used (after the HP Reverb Pro) - that list is: HP Reverb Pro, Oculus DK2, CV1, Rift S, Go, Quest 1, Quest 2, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Cosmos, Lenovo Explorer, Samsung Odyssey, Odyssey+, Pimax 4K, Pimax 5K+, OSVR and PSVR - so yeah, just a few.Short version - if you want a standing, roomscale headset for that AND PC VR this is the headset you want. If you play seated VR and don't care about roomscale you want the HP Reverb Pro.Pros:VERY clear image quality, nearly zero SDE (screen door effect)Fantastic priceGreat game selection (with the proper USB cable play any Steam VR game)Cons:Headstrap is pretty bad as you need to keep it very tight or it will ""sag"" on your face (so you really want the Elite strap which I'll review soon)Facebook will be required by the end of 2023 to even use it (but isn't quite yet)Faceplate material is rather scratchy and uncomfortable"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Switched from PSVR to Oculus Quest 2.  Won't go back!!!,"I've owned the PSVR on Playstation since it came out.  Loved it, although, a few things that I have to  mention to help my comparison to the OQ2...1. Hated the cords constantly getting tangled.  Not only that but if you didn't take care of the cords once your done playing, over time they start to crimp and I was worried that at some point the internal wires would snap making the headset useless.2.  The 180 degree view.  Anytime I turned my head to far left or right, the tracking would go nuts.  Same with motion controllers, they would jump out of view and you'd have to shake it to get it to re-track.3.  The headset in my honest opinion sucked.  It was to tight.  I tried everything and eventually unhooked the rubber band straps on both sides.  This allow it to sit on my head without squeezing the blood from my brain.  This very fact was the main reason I got motion sickness.  Once I relieved that pressure, I no longer got sick while playing.4.  Screendoor.  Wasn't bad but noticeable.NOW... the OCULUS QUEST 2:Blown away.  No cables to mess with, resolution is clear and sharp, headset on my head doesn't squeeze the life out of my brain, no screendoor effect.1.  The headset.  Honestly, I was actually nervous to put it on.  I was afraid I'd put this thing on and I'd get sick like the PSVR.  NOPE!  I was shocked.  The headset fit on my head perfect, no pressure points cutting blood from my brain... I played for 2 hours straight and didn't get sick.  My face felt like the blood had drained due to the pressure on my cheekbones but overall, awesome.2.  I've never played VR with high resolution.  I'm used to the PSVR and screendoor.  Fuzzy words, FOV sometimes sucked.  The Quest 2..  wow.  I just wasn't ready for high resolution and everything so clear, easy to read, no screen door.  What a huge difference.  I can see why people fork out 1K on higher end VR units.  Worth it.  Which is why the Quest 2 is a shocking piece of tech for the price.  Can't beat it.3.  360 degrees.  Being so used to 180 degrees,  it was awesome when I drew my perimeter around the living room and could walk in any direction without cables tripping me up.  Sounds funny but it was liberating to stand, sit, crawl, jump and walk anywhere.  Again, blown away and wish I would have jumped to wireless sooner.So many other things that blew my mind and in my opinion it blows the PSVR away.  YES, PSVR does have some great exclusives BUT the Quest 2 has Steam and all the games from FB with Virtual Desktop.  It's just awesome.  No other words for it.  My son owns PSVR and put it on last night as well...  it ruined it for him.  He instantly wants to get rid of his PSVR and switch to Quest 2.  Just an awesome piece of tech for the price.  No regrets."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just amazing!! Wow!!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   This is coming from a new VR user the last time I used VR was when I was using my Gear VR.  The oculus quest 2 is so easy to set up.  All you have to do is put on the headset and follow the instructions.  The only thing I have to complain about which I will not take off any stars for it is the head strap.  I'll probably end up ordering the head strap that is for the oculus quest 2.  Other than that this thing blows me away I would highly recommend purchasing one of these for yourself. And immerse yourself in VR."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Pretty cool,Got it first day haven't touched it but my dog loved using it but could only use the peanut butter flavor for him to want it.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Incredible, next level device and experience","I tried a couple of headsets a while back, and was consistently underwhelmed. Yes the sense of height and all that was incredible, and of course I saw the potential. But for a reasonably decent experience you had to be tethered to a PC, and it was always a bit of a wrestling match. ""Not ready for prime time"" was always my assessment.That's over. OVER. This device is next level beyond belief. After being wowed by the Home menus and so forth, I checked out a bunch of the freebie immersive animations, videos, etc. Very cool, a big step forward, but I again thought, ""is this it...if it is this device will be gathering dust in a couple of months.""So, I said let me check out a premium pay-for option. I played ""The Room"" as my first game purchase. I had actually played one The Room games on my iPad and enjoyed it, so eh why not.For two hours I did nothing but say ""OH MY GOD."" My wife got so sick of hearing me that she said LET ME SEE!!!! I put the headset on her, told her a couple of basic things, and she was off and running. Same reaction. OH MY GOD...OH...MY...GOD!!! I AM ON THE HOLODECK, I AM ACTUALLY ON THE HOLODECK!!!The immersive totality exceeded my expectations in every way. Sure, you're dealing with a big thing strapped to your head, and after a while you do find yourself adjusting it a lot (you eventually learn it's not supposed to sit on your nose, it's supposed to sit on your cheek bones, which not only makes it more comfortable, it makes the view clearer). I'm hoping the premium head strap thing cleans that up.Aside from that, I could go on and on. Even the sound quality kicks ass. (Some criticize it for not having earbuds, I think that might be a good thing...the isolation would be so complete you'd be completely unaware of your surroundings, which could be dangerous). And that was only with one game, some demos, and some casual exploring of the overall capability. There are apps that let you share your computer screen and WORK in a virtual space that other people can join and collaborate in. IT IS ASTONISHING and I'm going to try that out today (I'm a coder/techie guy by trade).Folks, unless you are some kind of VR prima donna, I absolutely assure you that quality VR for the masses has arrived. The device is an astonishing, next level triumph. I've been into video games for 45 years, even dabbled in development, and envisioned this experience, thinking maybe one day before I die I might see a piece of it.If this is where it's at now, then fully immersive Holodecks are really just a handful of engineering challenges now. In twenty years I have little doubt you'll be able to put some device in the middle of your room, turn it on, and get this experience.Next: objects that you can place in your playfield that you can physically interact with. Simple cubes and spheres that look like rocks, animals, anything. The controllers already do it; in ""The Room"", if you set the controllers on the ground and step away, you see a pair of leather gloves lying on the floor (your hands). You just walk over and pick them up.Again, on and on I could go. Astonishing. Well done Oculus."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"This thing can do a lot. Exceeded my expectations, even after looking at many reviews.","I'm giving this five stars because of the price, even though there are some slightly annoying things. It can take a bit of work positioning it on your face to get it as clear as possible. The face pad absorbs sweat, and since I'm using it mostly for exercise, I need to buy something like a silicone cover or a more easily washable replacement pad. Unfortunately, there are no-brand Chinese options, which I don't trust on my face, and most everything else is out of stock. It should include a good silicone cover in my opinion.Compared to the model I tried a few years ago, the pixels are barely visible, and overall the clarity is good. The view isn't very wide, but again - price. I was going to return mine because it looks like there is something on the inside of the lens or something, but I read that this is from light reflecting around inside and off your eyes. It comes and goes, so it may be just reflections that change with the content. I wish I could compare it to another to know if mine has an issue.I'm amazed how powerful the processor is - haven't experienced any stuttering of any operation. Streaming a virtual desktop from one computer to the headset (using Virtual Desktop app) and then casting to another computer worked great.Most people probably know a little about what these things can do. But it takes a while to get the complete picture. The details can get confusing, and we're still learning. For example, I bought a link cable because a YouTuber said it allows you to play PC games and see the PC desktop. But there is a wireless option (uses WiFi), the Virtual Desktop app, that cost about $30. The cable didn't work anyway, so I returned it. The company that makes the Virtual Desktop app has an accompanying desktop app that does the streaming. That let's you see the PC desktop in various settings, but you need to install the large Oculus Desktop application to play PC games with the headset. But none of our computers have a graphics card that is powerful enough. You need a beefy computer to play PC games on the Quest 2.But you don't need a computer at all to use the Quest 2. There are a ton of games that play natively on the Quest 2 that you download from the Oculus Quest app store. The computer inside is powerful enough to support decent games. There won't be the visual detail of a PlayStation, Xbox, or PC games, but that doesn't detract from the potential fun factor.My son is currently experimenting with Sidequest, which is a desktop program that makes it easy to ""sideload"" applications, separate from the Oculus app store. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with doing that, and provides a bunch of extra applications and capabilities.My 80+ year old dad asked ""what do these things do for you?"". I'll try and do my best to explain. If you are going to purchase one and want to discover things for yourself, then don't read further. What follows is more for people who aren't very familiar with these VR headsets.The headset has two displays so each eye can see a different image, allowing it to simulate depth perception. This is a big deal. Even though the display isn't as clear as a nice monitor, the headset makes you feel like you are really ""there"" - more on what ""there"" can be later. I live near mountains and find that a picture doesn't ever allow a viewer to get the feel of the scale and magnitude of the view you experience when standing there. I think this is because as you stand there and look around, your mind forms a detailed internal model of the mountains as you move your gaze around. When you look at a picture, the depth is hard to ""see"" - you have to infer distance intellectually, not automatically. And even if you could pan a picture back and forth on a computer screen, for some reason you just don't get the same impression. The difference is dramatic to me. So when you are looking through the headset at a 3D scene, your brain accepts that you really there.The headset has cameras in the four front corners that track your head movements, and the position and orientation of the controllers you hold in each hand. So when you turn or move your head, the view of the virtual world moves very precisely and close to what would happen in the real world. This can really help avoid feeling of nausea. I personally get a little sick if I play a 3D game on Xbox for a long time. When you pan your view left and right, the mismatch between what your eyes see, and the inner ear signals reaching your brain cause nausea. Once it sets in, it can last for hours. So having the headset move the virtual world to match your head movements, when standing still and looking around, is way better. This only applies when standing still. The opposite is true when you move in virtual space. Some 3D movies move you through virtual space, or a game may allow you to push the joystick to move around. I find that this makes me feel sick immediately. If the app has an option to ""teleport"" instantaneously to another point in space, then it doesn't make me sick. The quick transition is handled better by our brains. Some games have options to mitigate these effects using blinders, motion blur, or vignette effects when moving. This limits what you see when moving, so you can kind of see what is happening, but your brain isn't getting overloaded by it.Besides tracking your head movements, the cameras track the position and orientation of the hand controllers. This allows you to precisely point to things in VR, or interact with VR in other ways. There's a demo application that lets you pick up a virtual paper airplane and throw it. The airplane and other objects appears right in front of you on a desk. You reach out and position your hand over the object and pull both triggers to simulate gripping the object. To make it less annoying, it doesn't matter where you grip the airplane - it orients automatically. You perform a throwing motion and release the triggers at the right time. There is a ball on a string that you can punch, like tether-ball. I mention these only as examples. It's completely up to the application how hand motions translate to VR actions. A soccer app could make your hand movements affect the player's feet, because the headset can't track what your feet do. But most apps require hand actions, and the game mimics your real life motions in VR, which is very intuitive.The Quest has the ability to track your hand positions without having to hold the controllers. It does a great job of seeing your hand and finger positions. But it is limited in some ways. If you touch your hands together, it can't tell what it is seeing and your hands disappear in VR. And it isn't as precise as tracking the controllers, so if an app requires precise pointing, for example, you'll have to use the controllers.Given that the device can display any virtual ""world"" or space, and each controller has two triggers, two buttons, and a joystick, the possibilities of what these things can do is huge. They've been around for a few years, but they aren't mainstream just yet. The Oculus Quest 2 is selling well and the future looks bright.When you first turn it on, complete set-up, and log into your Facebook account (required), you'll see a couple of virtual flat panels with icons. Just like any operating system, the look of the interface will change over time. The controllers emit a virtual pointer that extends a few feet in virtual space, and the exact spot they are pointing to is shown with a small white dot. You click the main front trigger to select the option you are currently pointing to. You can open the app store, a browser, the ""TV"" app, settings, etc. Of course you can open an app that you've downloaded and installed.There are a ton of options. Here are some examples. You can install the Netflix app and watch content while sitting in a virtual rustic lodge, with a big screen surrounded by stonework. There are many other options for viewing 3D video content. These let you fly over mountains, or view ants up close doing their thing, and everything in-between. You can browse any web site. Some web sites contain 3D apps that you run by clicking the little headset icon (typically) to jump into 3D mode. There are educational apps - I saw one where ""you"" are in an artery and can reach out and examine white and red blood cells. You can view concerts or other entertainment, like comedians, very ""close up"". There are social apps where you can visit with other people in various virtual environments. There are virtual games like paintball. I found that games that allow you to shoot arrows are really cool - you bring the controllers up and together, pull one trigger to grab the string, and then pull a controller back from the other to draw the bow. Letting the trigger go lets the arrow fly. You can shoot surprisingly accurately. There are apps to create artwork and 3D models. Who knows what people will dream up?When I first started using this device, I found myself sometimes stuck, not knowing how to exit the app. In general once you figure this stuff out, most apps honor the common conventions, but some do their own thing and you have to experiment.There are options to record a movie of what you are seeing and doing, or take a screenshot.Personally, I'm using the FitXR exercise app the most. FitXR is a punching and dancing workout app. My legs and arms are tired from punching at balls and ducking under beams that come at you. So far, I haven't felt any tedium exercising this way. You have to focus and keep moving and you just lose yourself. There are a number of these types of games, Beat Saber being very popular, but I think they can be much better and more diverse. Some more advanced exercise apps require a monthly fee.Some games require you to move around a little. To keep you from running into walls or furniture, the Quest has two ways to define your movement boundaries. Once defined, when you get close to an edge, a virtual mesh wall gradually appears, and disappears when you move away from the edge. If you move outside the boundary, it goes into pass-through mode where the game stops and you can see your room through the external cameras. You can either define a small circular boundary right where you sit or stand, or you can draw a boundary of any shape to match your room obstacles. In the second case, it shows your real space through the cameras and you draw the boundary line on the floor by pointing and drawing with a controller. Very slick. At first, it was hard to trust, but as saw how well it works, I don't worry anymore. Even when I go to a different floor to get a drink or something, and come back, the boundary is still defined perfectly, and I can continue the game.I hope this helps some decide if the Quest 2 is for them."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Incredible!!,Bought this for my 14-year-old son. I tried it on and instantly was in another reality...I have never experienced anything like it! It will be fun to see what other games are like..where you interact with non-existent creatures!  I'd love to see a glove made with sensors rather than manipulating your virtual hands with buttons.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,4stars on amazon but 5star product,"My family and I love it! Listen, all these negituve reviews about having to have a favebook account are true, but ao what? I've had a Facebook account for almost a decade and havent had it banned once. Selling my info? So what? I search for a product and then products I'm interested in show up in my feed, Great!As for the headseat, it's so much fun to feel like your wielding a lightsaber with Darth Vader towering over you. For an old Socom ps2/3 player plus a gun nut like me to play Onward is an amazing experience. The rest of the games the family loves.Pros:The strap it comes with works for everyone in my family. Not buying an upgraded headstrap for 50bucks.The headset is lightweight and you wont really notice it when you are playing.Cons:You want to get a longer cable then what comes with the device. Not the $80 one that is made for it, I found a 10ft one on amazon for $14 (UGREEN USB C to USB C). I also use a 15' one.It takes over an hour to charge and only has a 2hr play time. We use a little backpack with a portible charger to prolong the playtime.If you do not mind the Facebook situation, buy one and be amazed by your VR experience"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Thoughts after a week of having my Quest 2,"So, I've had my Quest 2 for a week and here are my thoughts on it:1. Awesome VR headset. I've had some minor exposure to others (Playstation and others), but this my first dive-in, and I have to say it is great! The graphics, sound, and feedback from the controllers are amazing!2. Ability to play ""Beat Saber"". TBH, ""Beat Saber"" (a game where you slice and dice cubes to various songs) was one of the big reasons that I bought a Quest 2. I am proud to say that the experience is truly amazing. I get a good cardio workout while playing this amazing game.3. Immersion: The immersion factor is a 10 out of 10. I have done virtual exploration of Mars, riding along with folks in ""squirrel suits"", explored reefs, and other fantastic adventures with the Quest 2. Whilst playing ""Vader Immortal"", in the opening scenes, the scene reminiscent from ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" was just jaw-dropping gorgeous! It is all amazing - giving me the ""I am there"" experience one would expect from a virtual reality experience.With that said, there are some things to bear in mind:1. Facebook: Let's get the elephant out of the room: Facebook did buy Oculus and the EULA states that you need to use a Facebook account since the Oculus accounts (by themselves) are going away at the end of 2020. Thus, you will need to use your Facebook for everything Oculus. If you aren't comfortable with that, don't buy the Quest 2. It's that simple, since having a Facebook is a requirement.2. Phone app: The Quest 2 set-up did require me to use my phone to complete part of the registration by downloading the Oculus Quest 2 app. After completing set-up, I have not had to use the Oculus app on my phone since then.3. Pay to Play: Just like with any other gaming system, you will need to buy apps (games/fitness programs/etc.). A lot of the educational content is free, but entertainment tends to come with a price tag. Some are free with a monthly subscription, whilst others are pay once and then are done. Just know what you are getting into, and realize that the Oculus store is the only source of the content (afaik), so there isn't an option of doing price comparisons between different stores.4. Accessorizing: You will definitely need more than just the base unit if you want to get the most out of your Quest 2. I have purchased the extra battery/improved headband combo which definitely increased the VR session time. The Oculus branded case is also nice. If you are into intense gaming/fitness (or are planning to do so), you should get a silicone or other cover for the edges of the face, since you will generally sweat and that will make the absorbent sponge material on the Quest 2 rather gross. With a cover, you can wipe away the sweat and still not gross out anyone else wanting to play. You may want to invest in headphones if you are going to be in areas where you don't want to disturb others. Also, unless you ""cast"", nobody will be able to see what you are doing in the VR world, so that may be something to consider for a purchase. All in all, if you don't mind the FB requirement and the fact that you will need to spend a lot more than just the initial layout for the unit itself, then you will really enjoy the experiences that the Quest 2 has to offer."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Impressive technology, highly recommend getting a new strap though.","I haven't used it much but I'm considering replacing it with my HTC Vive. The resolution is great but the FOV isn't as big as PC headsets like the Vive and the Index but it still does a good job. This isn't an issue with the lens/strap fit of the headset, the Quest 2 only uses 1 LCD panel, so you end up seeing the edge of the screen. 90hz is amazing and the tracking is really PC like, very comparable if not better than the HTC Vive.It's really something else and I like this approach to VR more than smartphone VR and PC VR. Having the 360 room-scale freedom to take it wherever, play it anywhere, with no tether and running natively is incredible. Setting up new VR areas is easy and since there's no tether, you could literally make the Oculus Quest's playspace your entire house if you wanted to.I haven't even played a lot of games on it or even tried finger tracking/oculus link so I don't have much of a review atm since I just got the headset a day early. I will say I'd highly recommend getting the better strap and a better face mask, they're literally must haves for comfort. The original strap is literal garbage and takes forever to get the perfect fit and still isn't that comfortable. The battery strap looks really cool and I'll be trying to get that when it comes out."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Get it but be careful!,"DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!I cannot stress this enough. You CANNOT use Steam on this without a good computer for the Link Cable. Other wise you can only buy games from the Oculus app.Warning aside, I love this thing to bits! I've been really looking forward to finally playing some VR with my friends. Sure there are some limitations in some games but at least I still get to play with them!Totally worth the money!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best VR Headset Ever!,"I'll give my review of the Quest 2 1st & then some background info if interested.Quest 2: I purchased the 256GB model & also opted for the Elite Head Strap with built in battery & carrying case combo deal. (Which I highly recommend you get as well! The Elite Head Strap is dramatically better in every way than the standard, the integrated battery doubles your play time & you don't notice any weight difference & the official Oculus Quest 2 carrying case is well made & it all fits inside perfectly.)Quest 2 headset is very noticeably smaller & lighter than the Quest and/or Rift S. The integrated speakers sound great & are also a notable improvement. The resolution is so crisp & clear. Everything runs considerably faster too!Quest 2 with Oculus Link works perfectly & honestly better than my Rift S does!In case you are not aware, FB has stated that Go, Quest 1 are no longer being sold, Rift S will be discontinued next year as well. Going forward there will only be 1 Headset (with different storage options).Background info:My 1st headset was the Oculus Go, which I thought was awesome! The one thing I didn't like was you still needed a Rift to play PC games. So when the Quest & Rift S came out, I jumped all over the Rift S. The PC games were mind-blowing, but I missed the portability of the Go. Then FB comes out with Oculus Link which allows the Quest to also play PC games (essentially making it a Rift S on demand). I was so mad, because this left Rift S owner's like myself feeling cheated. Now FB is discontinuing the Rift line all together & going forward will only have 1 headset. Oculus Link eliminated the need for a PC specific headset."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blew it out of the park!,"I bought the Oculus Quest 2 for my first VR headset, so I had no idea what to expect. I never realized how cool it could be and how many different applications it could have in my everyday life. Before I got it, I thought that it would sit next to my PlayStation, and just be a different gaming console. BOY was I wrong. I LOVE watching movies and shows on it, or even looking at documents, as it makes it seem as if you're watching on a 20ft screen. When I play games on it, the response time is ridiculous, and most times I even forget that I'm still on Earth. I love this thing, and I use it almost every day. It has rightfully earned its place right next to my computer."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"6 steps forward, 2 steps backward. It’s the coolest thing since the iPhone and Tesla.","Biggest gripes about it is the LCD panel the blacks are no where near as good and it’s immediately apparent that everything looks kinda washed out. If you own an OLED cellphone and used the Quest 1, you’ll be quite bummed to see that the blacks look gray. Movie theaters look washed out black. Also an issue is the IPD; Thank God Almighty I have an IPD of 68mm and that’s perfect so I get to see clearly, but the downside to that is I see the edges of the LCD panel and my field of view is trimmed down by like 10%, meaning things feel smaller and further away, feeling as if I’m wearing the BUDGET model of Quest, comparatively speaking. I see the edges of the LCD.But through all this, I’ve owned it for 3 days now and I’m finally getting used to it. The screen is definitely clearer and the controllers are WAY more responsive. I have 100% more confidence in the tracking for some reason, and the inside out tracking is way more accurate. Also I have the VRCover facial interface, the Elite Strap Battery, and the G333 earbuds, and it made this thing incredible. I would have paid an EXTRA 50 dollars if they were able to use OLED instead of LCD, and bought a bigger panel, but maybe thats the best they can do at $299. I hope for Facebooks sake that they blitz the media with ads for this thing, and get this moving that way Sony PS5 VR has some good competition."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,New to VR - first impressions,"I have a lot of experience in gaming but pretty much new to VR.  I've been waiting for the tech to advance before  I decided to get on board.  For $299, I didn't think I would be losing to much to give this unit a try.  First impressions, after using it for a few days.... I am impressed.  I tend to suffer from motion sickness easily, so I was a little worried, but so far no issues with that.  I'm still exploring the content out there and checking out some games, but what I've seen so far it's been great.  I can see a great potential in the future of VR.  The gaming and educational possibilities are endless.  As for this unit, it is very easy to use, especially for someone like me with no VR experience.  The battery doesn't last too long, so I already ordered the extended battery w/ headstrap.  That's the other issue, starts to wear on the head a little after prolonged use.  I'm hoping the updated headstrap will help with that.  Lots of fun so far, I look forward to the future of this."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A stupid amount of fun,"I gotta admit I was completely dumbfounded by how far VR has come.  I held off on getting one but my buddy talked me into trying his and I was hooked.  While most games the graphics are not all that impressive, we are talking borderline Original Xbox to maybe Xbox360 level graphics, the overall game play is impressive.  The sensors are stupid accurate for the controllers along with headset.  The ""guardian"" system they use to keep you from running into things and setting your boundaries works extremely well.  The speakers are surprisingly awesome for being pretty far from your ears, you would never know it by the rich full sound they make.A couple small complaints though.  1st being the battery is pretty crappy.  I get about 3hrs of game time before it needs to be recharged, which by myself 3hrs would be fine but with 2 kids who want to play it too I find the battery is dead alot, thankfully it charges fairly quickly though. About 45 minutes to an hour.My other gripe is the lenses. 1) they are super easy to smudge, god forbid it touches your forehead when putting it on other wise you will have one blurry eye. It can also be a challange to adjust the headset so the picture is clear, at least for me.  I find i have to find the proper eye width setting then have the head strap super tight for the view to be clear.My last gripe is a software issue with their party chat, that needs some work for sure.  Their chat system is often overriden by games so its its difficult to maintain connectivity to your friends, its like the system wants to force you to interact with strangers and not just your friends.With all that said, yes I would recommend this to others, its just to much fun to not recommend.  Their first person shooter games are a blast but if you want a true mind blowing experience play Google Tilt Brush, you feel like freaking Tony Stark, even my wife who doesn't like games was blown away by that."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Having used other VR products, I'm Amazed","VR Background: I've owned two generations of the Samsung Gear VR (also running Oculus) as well as used the HTC Vive in the past.I have to say, this is the first VR product that I've used that makes me think the technology has reached maturity. Everything about this is iteratively better than previous VR devices I've used and the areas that show the most improvement are the pain points of previous devices.Screen: The screen is great. The resolution and pixel layout have almost entirely removed the screen door effect that was distractingly apparent on the Gear VR and HTC Vive. The 90hz refresh rate (turned on in the ""Experimental  Features"" menu is truly a game changer. I was able to play for several hours straight (trust me, you won't want to take this device off) without any eye fatigue or dizziness. The only thing lacking is the true black levels of OLED panels, but the slight grey-ness of the LCD is a small trade-off for all of the benefits.Controllers: Also incredibly well implemented. They are extremely light-weight, but don't feel cheap. Tracking is phenomenal and I like the trigger, joystick, and button placement. They are intuitive and comfortable to use for hours.Play space: Wow. The way you trace out your room-scale play space is so well conceived and implemented. The ""Guardian Box"" unobtrusively fades in when you get close until you are touching it in which it turns into a visual barrier. Once through it, the cameras turn on and you are able to see your surroundings, so make it a bit tighter so you don't end up walking into a wall or couch.The two things that really made me feel it was time to buy a ""real"" VR devices are the ability to tether to a computer for full-featured VR gaming, and the price. Don't get me wrong, this headset is completely capable of doing almost anything you could want in its standalone form, but the ability to tether really gives you some peace of mind that as the device ages, or a game comes out that requires a PC to run (cough, Star Wars: Squadrons, cough) you have the option to delegate the heavy lifting to a dedicated computer. With a $299 price tag, if you've been wanting to enter in the the VR space, now is the time."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oculus Quest 2,"Last Christmas I bought one of the Oculus products for the grands, and we had to return them because their computer systems weren't compatible with the VR device. I actually forget at this point what the problem was exactly, but they had to go back.The Quest 2 doesn't have a compatibility problem with anything. One issue: one grand had gotten as far as setting up the app and account in his phone in the system we returned. We both (and I'm pretty techno for an old lady) had such a difficult time getting his former account to register the new Quest 2, that he just started from scratch with a different eMail and different FB account. It was a project that shouldn't have been necessary.The other grand was starting from scratch and his Quest 2 was up and running in minutes.While the boys have used VR headsets on a few occasions, I had not and I am blown away by it! Enough that I actually want a system for myself. Video games, sure, I guess. Probably not so much for me. But I could live on the David Attenborough nature videos. Wearing the headset, you are there. You're in it. Pretty much all that's missing are the scents.As with other video setups, the grands can play against or with each other from different locations and different internet connections. They can also play against strangers and hear strangers and converse with strangers, but the ability to converse with strangers can be shut off for safety. And I highly recommend it. With that cut off, the grands are still able to converse with each other, however. I highly recommend that.There is plenty of free entertainment available, from videos to games. There are many games to buy, as well. They aren't cheap by the time you add a few on.For some games there is more activity involved using VR than using a standard video game system. If you're in the mountain climbing app, you have to physically move around or you won't be ""climbing,"" so that's more exercise than a kid would get sitting on the couch playing a video game. Not the same as climbing a tree, but our grands also climb trees so it doesn't worry me that they aren't ""outside"" because they are outside all the time.Bringing me to, unlike standard video game systems that are connected to power and can allow a kid to sit for endless hours playing video games, the VR headsets run on battery power and the battery doesn't last endlessly. It's like a built-in time limit. It takes about an hour for the device to recharge to full power, so that's an hour the kids can come to the table, have dinner, grunt a few nays or assents to others by way of ""conversation"" and then get back to their games. Or be distracted so they forget the games and do something else. Don't scoff. I've seen it happen!I'm sure some kids will attach a battery pack to extend playing time. But my grands aren't.Anyway, virtual reality headsets are fun and interesting, and open up the possibility of who knows what cool applications suitable to anyone in the family. I love it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,True Next Gen,"The Oculus Quest 2 is truly next gen. I have been a life long gamer for the past 35 years, beginning with atari. I have upgraded to the newest consoles whenever a new one was released. I did this up to the PS3, then kind of lost interest in games as I began to get bored of the graphics updates and not much else.With the way 2020 went, I no longer had my normal stress & exercise outlets. I heard good things about the Quest 2 & decided to get one a week after launch. As soon as I put it on, my mind was blown. I instantly transported to a different universe when I did the first steps tutorial. The experience was amazing. The controllers felt comfortable & intuitive. The headset took a little adjustment to get comfortable, but wasn't horrible. I definitely suggest upgrading to the elite strap or other 3rd party add on (like I did) to made the headset more comfortable & less 'front heavy'.The games are all reasonably priced with plenty of free games & experiences. There are routine sales in the Oculus store, so keep an eye on your wishlist games & pick them up when they are on sale. Most games are between $15 and $40. One of my favorite games is Walkabout Mini Golf and is only $15 at full price but offers an amazing mini golf experience with high replayability.I find that I'll get about 2 hours of battery life out of the headset, but have extended that to about 8 hours with the use of a power bank.I've read a lot of people complaining about the Facebook login requirement, but this is greatly exaggerated. These are the same people who don't realize their phones are already spying on them with or without Facebook. I've been in the technology industry for 20 years & realize that all my data is already being mined by many companies... It's the price of using technology.There is a bit of an adjustment period to VR known as 'getting your legs' which is similar to getting your sea legs. I found this was about a week or 2 before my brain understood the VR world was not real life. I do stick to mostly comfortable games where the movement is by teleport action since I've had real life motion sickness in the past. Fortunately, there are a lot of comfortable games available to people who are prone to moron sickness (For example, Arizona Sunshine offers teleport movement & I experienced zero motion sickness).My friends & family who tried the Quest 2 were blown away. My mother (in her 70's) thinks it's amazing. My friends bought a quest 2 & we now hang out in VR. It really feels like we are hanging out in person, which is really fun.If you are on the fence based on some of the negative reviews, I highly recommend the purchase. I haven't had this much fun with a new 'console' since opening my super Nintendo Xmas morning & popping in Street Fighter 2 back in the 90's."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best spent $300 EVER!!,"I can't begin to describe how much I've enjoyed this!! The games are fun (I really only purchased it for beat saber) but the immersive 3D experience with Oculus TV and 3D movies has benn AMAZING!  I have an older Oculus and I absolutely LOVED going around the world with Google Earth.  I only hope Google Earth comes to Oculus Quest soon then this would be perfect.  I watched some guy traveling up Everest (not the movie, it was a documentary of sorts) and that experience alone was worth the $300 because now I don't need to spend money training and going there for myself!  Seriously - this technology is so cool!  You'll need to finagle the eye pieces a bit to get it to look right, but even the sound is super impressive.  You can use headphones/earbuds or listen right from the unit without - it sounds fantastic!  I only got the 64GB version which is fine for what I do since I don't plan on playing any huge hardcore games and so far I've only used like 8GB.  If you have an extra $300 lying around - BUY THIS!!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Dis shid bussin.,This is the best game SYSTEM I’ve ever bought. Yes system. Stand alone. I was under the impression I would need a computer for this obviously I didn’t do much research before hand. This thing blows me away. For 300$. Bish I’m here for it! 👏👏👏. I👏 love👏 this 👏thing👏. All my friends love it. It’s great for get togethers we can all watch what the person is playing on the smart TV wirelessly. My only qualm here is the battery life. But external battery packs are inexpensive so it was an easy fix. I know a lot of people have been having a lot of issues with fb and their account being locked. I haven’t had any issue so far and it’s been several months since my purchase. I’ve never had issues with fb in the past either. Buying games is super easy too. You can buy from the phone app or in the store on the headset. The original head strap pretty uncomfortable after prolonged use there are lots of affordable options available. And for the love of your oculus please use the wrist cuff things. I was playing a horror game and through my controller across the room. No damage taken. But it could have gone much worse. In conclusion this is amazing. Fb really got ahead of the game with this. 👏
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best VR headset!,We got the Oculus Quest 2 - 256 GB.  This thing is awesome!  You really feel instantly transported to another place.  The graphics and sound are what you would expect to find at the major arcades.  The kids and I love the games.  Wife found some exercise and meditation apps that she loves.  It is a standalone system but I think you can connect it to a computer with an additional cable. 10/10 best purchase ever!
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Good VR investment,"This is my second quest the first one being the original and all I can say is I love it for what it is damn good VR game play with out all the cords. Is it worth it you ask. Well yes it’s very well worth it and you are only limited to your play area or you can make it a massive play area you can play in with out all the cords or wires being attached to you and a pc, graphics are also amazing for it being a stand alone VR headset and I personally feel like it’s just going to get better. Also some may see it as a down side that you must have a Facebook account to use the headset but who doesn’t have a Facebook account already  like seriously what do you have to hide if you are not doing anything illegal you already carry all personal info on a cell phone ok now back to the subject would I say get a quest yes of course I would its mobile its mobile VR gaming at its best. Oh and before I forget you can also hook it up to a pc That is VR ready and go to the main oculus website and download the rift app and play pc VR games as well and steam VR games."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Buy it now!!! Too much fun! And can be great exercise!,I’m over 50 and for the most part hate gaming as I think it’s a huge waste of time and causing our youth to lose any sense of creativity among many other things. When my fiancé came home and said she had a played it at a friends home and it was incredibly fun and a good workout I decided to buy one for her. She’s got to play once lol. OMG it’s such a blast and I’m so sore 2 days later from the workout I got. I purchased Beat saber and a boxing game. What a true workout as I boxed like I was in a real ring with an opponent and I whipped him good too! Lol. My dad was a boxer so I was raised with a few good combinations and know how to shuffle my feet. Then I took a tour to Dubai and went t clubbing in Tokyo. They mix a drink and set it in front of you and it’s so realistic (3D) you wanna pick the drink up. It has a calorie counter and I set my goal at 150 just for starters. Playing beat saber and ind of dancing to the music as I played Hans Solo I burned 150 calories in matter of minutes. Trust me your never to old to enjoy something this cool. You can even surf the web on it. It’s like having a big 80” screen floating in front of you. BUY IT!!  You won’t regret it. I also advise getting some face coverings because you’ll sweat so much (if you want too and play the games). Too much fun for sure. There’s a learning curve if your not a gamer and I learn a little more each time I use it. Haven’t really found a manual but I’m more of a jump in and swim kind of guy anyway so I’m doing fine learning it. My only regret is Facebook owns it and I have a lot of disdain for Zuckerberg and most of the tech titans that are pushing their influence on this wonderful country.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It's fun,"The fifth star is for price.Let's compare to Quest Original:Q0 wins:Screen blacknessPupillary distance adjustmentCross buy with some Go appsComes with a decent strapQ2 wins everything else:Higher ResolutionScreen door effect almost goneBetter processor can do better graphics.More comfortable controllersMore accurate controllersMore memoryLighterI could probably go on.The real trade offs are the strap and the screen.Let's face it, Oculus never understood comfort.  This is the most comfortable one yet.  Wireless and reasonably light.  You can get a better strap.  People got better straps for their Q0s too.The screen trades blackness but gains resolution and the screen door grid from Q0 is gone.  Ok it's (barely) there but the other issues that are in both headsets are far worse.I don't count the ipd adjustment as a big deal but maybe I'm lucky with my head size.  Honestly I was never satisfied with the Q0 and was always fiddling with itOculus Quest 2 is an excellent device, especially for the price.It's not perfect in any way and there will certainly be better in a few years but it's fun."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing VR experience- no “strings” attached.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I absolutely love vr. My previous vr experience has been from playing the PSVR, but this adds total freedom- no wires to hold you back. Love the controllers and the tracking feels great. I love how I can safely move around which adds a new level of gameplay. Now I can take a full approach for bowling or freely move around a boxing ring. Very happy with this purchase. I also purchased the elite head strap with the extended battery and case. Love it- can’t wait to see what the future holds. Go buy one, you will love it. Where’s the PSVR 2.0 (I don’t think I can go back to wires)."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Better than I expected-I am obsessed,"I am not considered a ""gamer."" Sure, I love a good Mario bros or Tetris, I've played the Lego Wii games with my kiddo. I love the interactive platforms. I got a Wii when it came out and the Kinect on Xbox when it came out. I was pleased but not obsessed with these. I thought this purchase would be a fun toy to treat myself with during this crappy year. I AM OBSESSED. First, there was so much interactive and interesting free content to explore that it was a couple weeks before I even bought my first game. Watching content such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, and YouTube is INCREDIBLE. It feels like you are in a theater, which you have all to yourself, and it's easy to get lost in it and lose track of time. Watching Game of Thrones (which was never released in theaters) is AMAZING! There is some free VR content including YouTube360 and Amazon has a few VR options which are just amazing. You can explore the bottom of the sea and the peaks of the mountains, ride rollercoasters without waiting in line, and more. INCREDIBLE. I purchased my first game, Jurassic World, and I am just floored. While flying in an airplane, you can walk up to the window and look out at what you are flying over. You can literally peak your head around corners before entering rooms to look for raptors. Getting attacked by a raptor is a little heart stopping! Lol I cannot recommend this more!! I am more than pleased with my purchase!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Wireless VR is great!,"My first VR headset was an original Rift CV1 that I bought earlier this year. Didn't have any real problem with it aside from having to actively make sure the tether cable didn't come to harm (they aren't manufactured any more and are expensive to replace). So I saved up some money and got a Quest 2. Outside of the Rift CV1 and Quest 2, I haven't used any other VR headset for comparison.First impression was that the screen quality is a nice upgrade. I don't notice the screen-door effect at all on the Quest 2. Colors are more vibrant. And I wasn't bothered by the default 72Hz refresh rate either (the CV1 is 90Hz). First game I tried was Pistol Whip, and it ran ok. I heard something about the edges of the screen being visible at the highest IPD setting (3); I didn't notice anything out-of-place or significant at all (it's possible the same happens on the CV1 and I'm used to it).Having spent most of my money on PCVR games and now the Quest 2, I can't afford the popular Virtual Desktop application for streaming PCVR games over wireless. But I own an AMD graphics card (RX 580), and AMD actually created and includes their own wireless VR streaming tech called Relive VR in their drivers! It supports some other standalone VR headsets (notably Quest), and also works fine on the Quest 2. I side-loaded it onto my Quest 2, figured out the PC set-up (have to start up SteamVR before running the app on the Quest), and was good to go!The first PCVR game I tried was Blade & Sorcery... and it was amazing. SteamVR reported it was still running at 72Hz (even with the 90Hz adb command trick), but that didn't matter. The clarity of text and everything was a huge step-up from the CV1, and colors were really notably more vibrant. And then... I did a full 360 spin to get an enemy, and was instantly sold on wireless VR; having no tether cable to worry about is amazing!Beat Saber (PCVR) didn't work quite well at all with Relive VR though; latency was a bit too high. Guided Meditation VR worked mostly ok, but the Quest 2 turned the screen off in the middle of a session (I'm thinking it's a default power-save option since I wasn't interacting with the controllers or moving), and I had two cut-outs (I'm thinking because of my router). Until You Fall (PCVR) worked ok. I'll likely need to optimize my set-up more.The other cool thing is passthrough. I had to enable the double-tap feature from experimental features in Oculus settings, but it's great for finding out where I am in my room, or grabbing a drink from the table, without having to take off the headset or (like I usually did previously), try to awkwardly look through the little space between the facial interface and nose on my CV1 (no passthrough). Managed to walk up and down some stairs with passthrough too, so it's clear enough for that, but trying to actually look at my PC screen was pretty difficult; using a virtual desktop app (not to be confused with the ""Virtual Desktop"" app for wireless streaming mentioned above although it might offer the feature; something like the Desktop viewer in SteamVR) works a lot better.The default strap seemingly works fine, but I'm expecting an elite strap to arrive in the future. I was concerned about the default strap being terrible based on what I heard from others online, but it's not too bad at all. My CV1's strap was a lot more comfortable though, and I wonder if the elite strap comes close to that experience.The included charging cable is relatively short, and only USB 2.0. You can use it to side-load applications from a PC to the headset, and you can use it (ideally with an extender) for Oculus Link, albeit not to the greatest experience since the cable end on the headset sticks straight out, and that Link is being limited by the USB 2.0 cable. With the upgraded wireless specs in the Quest 2 (compared to original Quest), wireless VR can be more ideal if you have a decent router. But if you need or want a Link cable, there's options available, and you don't necessarily need the expensive official cable from Oculus (although it is quite nice for what it is; it's lightweight, long, optical, and official).And for some other random tips, you can use a Nintendo Switch charger to charge the Quest 2. ALVR didn't work ideally for me (got VR discomfort quickly just from SteamVR home; I don't know what it's doing to render). SideQuest is apparently being hammered by new users signing up. I paired the Quest 2 headset no issue on my iPhone 6s Plus with iOS 14.0.1 and had no issues enabling developer mode. Passthrough mode shows all infrared light, including from remotes, and interesting enough, from the Rift CV1 controllers and HMD. You can cast straight from the headset to a Chromecast-compatible device/TV, or to (paired?) mobile devices."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"The new entry point for VR newcomers, and a compelling value for VR vets","Without reservation, this is the best VR experience you can have without an expensive gaming PC and headset that costs twice as much. But saying Quest 2 is the best in the (not very competitive) stand-alone VR field is probably still selling it short. It's also one of the best PC VR headsets, and not just for the price.As a longtime VR advocate, Quest 2 is the first stand-alone VR headset that I feel comfortable recommending without reservation. It actually manages to deliver all of the key aspects needed for real, high-quality VR. The self-contained inside-out tracking can deliver full roomscale play, and tracking is rock stable with few practical issues. And since it's wireless, it's much easier to set up large play space and explore without getting tangled up in a cord.As essentially a mobile device, performance can't compare to PC, but it's really impressive how capable the XR2 chipset is. It's actually not too far behind the base PS4 in its capabilities, and some games are able to achieve real console-quality results. As of right now, most games are written for Quest 1 and don't take advantage of the new hardware, beyond a resolution bump, but expect things to improve.The biggest disadvantage for the stand-alone experience is presently the software library. It's not bad by any means with a lot of really good ports of popular favorites and a growing library originals, but it can't compare to the PC and PS4 libraries. It's especially thin on big, immersive long-form content; a few games like Walking Dead Saints and Sinners are changing that, but for now most of it's best games are shorter arcadey experiences.If you do own a good gaming PC, however you can connect the Quest 2 with a USB-C cable (not included) and it works as a full featured Oculus Rift-compatible headset. As of the new v23 software release (Nov 13, 2020) this functionality is out of beta, and has been significantly improved compared to launch (so note that older reviews are essentially reviewing a different experience).Oculus promised that Quest 2 would be their best PC VR headset, and this new update makes good on that promise, by allowing games to run at full native resolution, and 90Hz refresh rate. The Quest 2's screens are incredible, completely eliminating the grainy ""screen door effect"" visible in most headsets. The 1832x1920 resolution is 3.5 times the pixel density of the original Oculus Rift, and finally sharp enough that reading text is no longer a chore and watching movies or browsing the web feels as sharp as looking at a 1080p monitor. If you're new to VR that might not sound impressive but it's a night and day improvement.The caveat, here, is compression, and I have found this depends a bit on hardware. RTX nvidia cards have additional hardware to handle compression and I have found that this doesn't just improve the performance but the image quality as well. On my RTX 2070 compression is almost completely rendered a non-issue. But my experience with the software-based compression was more mixed, with most scenes looking great but certain low-contrast areas displaying banding or artifacts. I am not sure about AMD cards.But the Quest 2's killer feature for PC VR is definitely wireless paly over Wi-Fi. With a 5Ghz router and the right set up this is a fantastic experience, with very little additional latency. But this feature isn't enabled out of the box, it requires purchasing an $20 app from the store (Virtual Desktop), and sideloading a patch. I was really amazed at what a great experience this was, far better than expensive earlier solutions like TPCast or Vive Pro Wireless. For some this is probably the single best reason to choose Quest 2 as you PC VR solution. Do note, though that this method is a little more demanding on the hardware so users running lower spec machines may prefer to stick to wired to get the benefits of Oculus' frame interpolation.I have been using my Quest for about a month now. I have been a VR user since the Rift launched in 2016, and I am completely blown away by how great the Quest 2 is. The improved resolution is a massive upgrade by itself, and wireless play is transformative. And even as a PCVR snob I am genuinely impressed by the stand-alone experience, it's real, full-fledged VR for the masses, and a much better entry point than PSVR, the old baseline for ""real"" VR in a budget."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"For a average gamer looking to get into VR, this is good value for the money.","I picked up a Samsung HMD Odyssey+ (which is Windows Mixed Reality) a couple of years ago for $230 and was pretty happy with it and used it for SteamVR, despite the early issues with WMR support in many of the games. Over time most of those issues were smoothed out and it's a great experience now. I didn't like the way the Odyssey+ would lose controller tracking when I had the controllers against my chest (my usual rest position) or when moving my hands to the sides or backwards. This this was the only real problem I experienced with the Odyssey+ that had no solution.Earlier this year I was able get a 64GB Quest 2 for $199 (new, open box) and picked up a 3rd party 16ft USB cable for using it with SteamVR, and when comparing the 2 headsets I liked the experience with the Quest 2 a lot better overall. It was a higher resolution than the Odyssey+ and I had no real problems with the Oculus Link even with a 3rd party cable, and has the option of going wireless at some point. The controller tracking on the Quest 2 is outstanding compared to the Odyssey+, the Quest 2 completely solved that problem for me (and it can do hand tracking, but not in SteamVR mode at this time).But the ability to turn off the computer and still engage in VR experiences was the real clincher.  I enjoy the ability to use YouTube without needing a computer, or Wander (uses Google StreetView, but wirelessly without a computer) to scout out locations I plan to visit or to see locations I'm NOT planning to visit, or even playing Real VR Fishing or Topgolf golf for a quick game to relax.I try to avoid buying games on the Quest 2 that I already have on SteamVR (Arizona Sunshine, The Wizards series, Creed, Onward, Superhot VR, etc.), though that might change if they go on sale through the Oculus store (Arizona Sunshine particularly). You do need to have SteamVR support to take advantage of the Humble Bundle VR bundles that some up on occasion (some great deals in these bundles), which the Quest 2 can do.I can take the Quest 2 with me when I leave the house and can use it even without WiFi as a lot of games support the offline mode. Or I can use at a friend's house or while traveling. I added a ZMI Powerpack 10K so I get more time on the headset and upgraded to a silicone face cover and a Devansi Head Pad (all of these white) to make it more comfortable as well. It's pretty versatile!I'm real happy with my purchase and planned on buying one at some point in 2021, though that $199 price tag was just too good to pass up and got it a lot sooner than expected!!As it's more than just a tethered VR headset, it's the best thing going in VR hardware right now and even at full price it's a good deal. If you're hardcore into VR, then this is a good backup when your main rig goes down (which it eventually will, usually through some flubbed update or other event).But for a average gamer looking to get into VR, this is good value for the money. And screw the people complaining about needing a Facebook account! You need a Sony PayStation account for the PlayStation, you need a Microsoft account for Xbox, a Nintendo account for Nintendo consoles, a Blizzard account for WarCraft, a Steam account for ANYTHING on Steam, an EA account for Apex Legends, an Epic account for Rocket League, an Ubisoft account for Assassins' Creed or Star Trek Bridge Crew, a SWTOR account for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a Daybreak account for EverQuest II, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc!! And do you think all these services AREN'T monetizing your information, hmmm?? Give me a break..."

5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Absolutely Incredible thus far,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I just got in the Oculus Quest 2 this week and have been loving it. I've been always interested in the VR space for a long time and felt like now is a good time to get into it. Mainly with Half Life: Alyx available as the first huge AAA game to focus on VR.Picking this up on pre-order at $299 was the perfect price for what they have to offer IMO. 90hz, increased resolution, overall improvements over the last Quest seems like the perfect combination for entry level VR. Seems sort of hard to say entry though, because my experience thus far is phenomenal. Utilizing the controllers for grabbing and detection of your fingers is super neat. Grabbing objects, throwing them, shooting guns, dancing with a robot, it's nuts and it's easy to experience in the first tutorial.I immediately ordered a USB-C 16ft cable to go along with it to hook up to Steam VR / Oculus Link on my desktop and it worked perfectly. Loaded up Half Life: Alyx, and took off. Everything worked well with the game and highly recommend running through it with this. All I needed was the one cable and a capable machine and I was good to go. I was absolutely blown away by the experience with the Quest 2 and Half Life: Alyx, it was like nothing I've ever played before getting up close and personal with one of my favorite franchises.If you're interested in VR, I would highly recommend checking this out. I will say the only downside so far is there is a lot of pressure on the forehead without the ""expert / advanced / upgraded"" headset add-on for $50 or something. For now I'll just keep adjusting the headset, but it does limit some length of time I'd be able to play for.As far as ""screen door effect"" goes with a lot of VR experiences that people discuss, I do notice this just ever so slightly if your eyes aren't adjusted to the lenses. But I assume there's only so much sharpness you can achieve at the moment with this resolution.Overall, I highly approve and can't wait to check out more games with this. Hope it helps!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,¡Solid room-scale VR!,"I purchased the Oculus Quest 2 to replace my aging HTC Vive that I purchased several years ago. Overall, the Quest 2 is a decent upgrade. I immediately noticed the superior visual clarity of the Q2 over the original Vive. The best thing is the easy setup. The Vive had a lot of cables to connect and/or plug such as hdmi, usb, lots of power plugs due to base stations and what not, and etc. It was always a nuisance. But with the Quest 2 there is none of that. Just the headset and two controllers. A huge improvement. Plus, it can be connected to PC for PCVR games. I wirelessly connected my Quest 2 to my PC and was able to stream my old Steam VR games from the PC to the Quest 2 and play, without any cables connected, no problem. Yes, no cables at all. It was great! The best way to experience room-scale for sure is by being untethered. And on top of that, the self-contained Quest games on the Oculus store are not bad either! You can play anywhere."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing Buy!!!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   This is a late review but I like to try out products at least a few months before I review them. My 13 year old was so excited when this came in the mail for her, she was so surprised best gift ever. She is now a gamer..lol me too. It's very durable she takes it everywhere in her backpack, it charge quick and is super fun to play. She downloaded a lot of virtual job simulator games. I personally like the exercise, dance and boxing games. This was definitely worth the purchase.. more like an investment.  Can't wait to buy two more because my son prefer playing this instead of his Playstation 4 VR. And the other twin now wants a black one. Ready Player One is NOW, they don't want to leave the virtual world especially because there's no social distancing in there. I highly recommend this product."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,By far the best VR headset in...,"I have tried many VR headsets. I started using headsets since google cardboard and cellphone based headsets like Samsung Galaxy VR (which wasn't too bad). I tried the first Oculus series as well as many newer PC based VR headsets including Windows Virtual Reality based headsets (Samsung Oddessy plus and ...). When Oculus 2 was ready to launch, I had it on the very same day (thx to Amazon). The Oculus Quest 2 is the best virtual reality headset by far based on the value and it's capabilities. It's not perfect and this industry still has a long way to go but it's way more practical than anything else I have ever tried. This is a headset which gives you options for using it on the go and completely wireless or by connecting it to a powerful PC, you can have one of the most powerful VR headset anyone could dream about, all with a reasonable cost that most people can simply afford (thx to Facebook). The headset is very comfortable and light. It's very well designed and has the biggest virtual reality platform (Oculus) behind it. You can simply open and use any game and app which is made on steam as well (by using the Oculus wire). I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone. Have fun and enjoy the technology and endless possibilities."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Totally awesome!!,"Yeah, glad I waited to jump into VR. Id love to write all the Pros and Cons of this device and I have to say, many people will find Cons. Not that they really are Cons but for some, there will be a few tiny things that might bother. But, for those that have a pair, this thing is probably the most coolest product of the 2000's. I can't wait for the Quest 4. Until then though, all I can say is: if you play games or want to play games...are into tech and enjoy experiences larger than life...then buy this thing. It is immersive and the fidelity of the display is pretty amazing. Beat Saber is, well, everything that I could not have imaged it is...And Vader Immortal, just , like, you actually are in the Star Wars world...ALl the YouTube VR video stuff, the Oculus Player, my friend just got one yesterday, and we raced rollercoasters. I can't explain how much of a fun trip this device is. I am re-thinking if I'll now buy an Xbox Series X in a few weeks. I just now can't look at regular machines same way. Granted, this device is not something you play for mass hours in a row. For me, ill use it though prob every day and have for 30 minutes to 1 hour at at a time and that is plenty. Knowing I can go anywhere on this planet or in the galaxy anytime i want, is pretty cool. There are two kinds of people in this world...Those that get the Quest 2 and realize what true VR amazement and freedom is...and those that have never had any VR experience and think its not for them. Which one are you?"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Let the oculus take you anywhere you want to be, From the North Pole to Mars,","This item is fantastic. Whether 5 or 65.. It allows you to transform yourself into a place where you could imagine anything possible, We downloaded rollercoasters to ride,  granddaughter has walked on the moon, beat saber has us doing exercise and dancing, You can interact with your friends and family who are in other homes, It helps you connect the fear of flying as there are classes, I have sailed the caribbean, We have been to the North Pole and walk the plank... This is simply the most wonderful new invention and fun family treasure.. A definitely must buy for 2021 and beyond"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The best VR money can buy!,"Oculus quest 2 is currently the best VR money can buy, its light weight, affordable and visually imported however the only cons I have faced is you have to buy a type c to USB so you can access your PC Library,  another con is you have to buy oculus elite strap for optimum comfort and convenience, the stock strap isn't horrible but it can be annoying sometimes for me. If you have solved these cons, the Oculus quest 2 can be the perfect VR out there."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing!!!!!,"We LOVE this thing!! My husband & I each got one.  We can travel the world without leaving the couch!! It's amazing!! Great quality visuals, fairly easy to operate. We got them up & running with no issues within the first 15 minutes of unboxing.We aren't necessarily tech-savvy, but we were able to figure out set up & use quickly.  It comes with a partial charge to set it up, and doesn't take long at all to fully charge. One charge lasts several hours. To get the most out of battery life, we wait until it's below 30% before we charge it. When you take it off your head it goes into sleep mode, which slowly uses battery life, and to shut down you must power it off.64GB is plenty for what we're using them for; we only watch 360/180/3d videos,  and don't play games on it. Anything not in virtual format looks like you're simply at the movie theater in the front row, which is nice. If you do play games on it, I'd suggest getting the 264GB. We've each downloaded about 9 apps to get more videos to watch, plus there are plenty of free ones, and we haven't even used half of the storage space yet.We only use one cell phone between us, and it's an android. You don't need a phone to use it, but you do need at least one, or a computer, to first download the free Oculus app to set up your Oculus headsets once you get them. My phone's bluetooth paired both Oculus devices on my account. I'm able to link my headset to my FB account; my husband can connect using mine. (Haven't figured out yet if he can connect to his FB account thru mine though,  but he really doesn't care about that anyway. He's just happy he can use it) This way, he's logged on with my user name, but he's able to download whatever apps/videos he wants on his headset, see whatever he wants,  and we can watch different things on each device, or use the same app at the same time if we choose. *Also, we purchased a Kiss concert, and as long as we both downloaded the free app it was offered on (on each of our headsets),  we both have access to the concert, and only paid one price.For me,  if I'm on the Oculus too long,  it feels like sensory overload; my eyes, head,  & brain get tired, so I have to limit my time using it, which is hard because it's so fascinating, lol.  The only thing I don't like is that the headset feels a little front heavy, and the strap it comes with feels very tight if I have it adjusted where I can see perfectly. The oculus itself has soft foam around the eye area which is comfortable, but being so heavy, it rests on my eye socket/ upper cheek area, and feels like it's pulling my bottom eyelids down. I'm afraid it'll give me premature bags under my eyes lol. For that reason, I suggest getting a replacement strap for another $40, which distributes the weight more evenly, and is much more comfy than the straps that it comes with, and has a dial in the back to adjust it easier (to fit any size head).Also,  we learned the hard way that if you have slow internet (wifi), it'll take FOREVER to download an app/video,  and it'll freeze frequently, which is extremely frustrating. That alone almost rendered these things useless in our book. We upgraded our wifi to panoramic wifi,(which only ended up being $5/mo more in cable than we were already paying),and immediately noticed a HUGE difference! Where it took hours to a full day to download something,  it now takes less than a couple minutes, and never freezes,!!Overall,  these are the best things since sliced bread!!!!!!  Everyone should have one!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I always wanted one and finally took the plunge. Super fun.,"This thing is really fun.  I enjoy this and so does the rest of the family.There are many games that have free demos, that are limited so you will buy, but where you can try out features and experiences.  I love it.  I really do.  I find that some of the games and experiences are so well done that they can mess with my balance.  Something roller-coasters and boats etc never do.  Want to see what I mean try some of the roller coaster demo levels and options.Beat saber is a blast for young and old.The battery life is really good for both the headset and the handsets.  The controls are mostly intuitive.  There was a learning curve to the main menu that was a little steep for me.  I wonder what it was patterned off of or what it was trying to really be.  But after enough effort you soon learn the ropes.I do see remove for improvement with it overall but those are really just nice to haves.  With the users here we have head sizes all over the map.  The straps are a little... fiddly... to get right when changing this much.  Given that so many families I know are buying these I wold have loved to see it be a bit easier/quicker to deal with.The games for it, as with any new device XBOX PlayStation etc.., can feel really expensive at first but then you stop buying and start playing and the sticker shock fades like normal.  The demos that are free to download and install help to really reduce the fear of buying the wrong thing.  There are sales to help with this but it can take time for something you want to makes it's way into a sale.  So when the go on sale strike while the iron is hot.One young boy who was using it started to get headaches when using it.  But reduced the sheer amount of time spent playing with it and that all stopped.It was worth the price and sure has been a great deal of fun.One last note.  Using a 3D Printer some additional add-ons have been created for the Quest 2 to try and help with things and they do seem to have helped with some of the short-comings.  So if you have one or know someone who does and run into issues and think ""it sure would be nice if..."" someone may have already gotten there for you."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just buy it it will be worth it,"I don't play video games. I'm 42 and I have highschool seniors. I decided to buy a couple of these to see how they were its VR! We have playstations all over the house and I tried to get the new 5 with no luck like most of the rest of the population. Damn bots. Anyways, I'm so glad I did these games are so realistic its crazy, I will more than likely buy 1 or 2 more so the whole family can have their own. If youre wondering if its worth the money it absolutely is, not the same as other vr systems way better than playstation vr. 2 gamesyou gotta buy are walking dead saints and sinners and population one. Theres other good ones but those are absolutely the best to me. But I do like games with guns in them. GO BUY THE OCCULUS or beg your parents to. Its worth the chores and getting A on your report card. For those whose parents require that silly stuff."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just what I wanted,"I was looking for a ""fun"" fitness alternative and something that would get me up and moving. The quest 2 fits the bill perfectly. Yes, you need a real Facebook account to use it, but since I've been a Facebook and smart phone user for over a decade I figure they already have all my info so it doesnt bother me. I got this primarily for fitness and play Beat Saber and Fit XR, both of which give a decent cardio workout. When I use it with my Bluetooth earbuds it's a fully immersive experience. Some people may find they get a little queasy the first couple times using. My suggestion is to ease into longer use and don't over do it and you'll adjust to the vr environment without feeling ill. Would definitely recommend as a way to be more active while having fun."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Unbelievable!,"I have always been intrigued with VR but until now felt there was a ways to go before it was really any good ( quality graphics ).  I finally decided to go with the Oculus Quest 2 after reading all the latest reviews and seeing the positive reviews.  Well, all I can say is.....THIS IS TOTALLY MINDBLOWING!  I have never had so much fun in my life ( and I'm not even playing games! ) I have just been watching YouTube 4k videos on my virtual desktop and I am totally blown away.  It's like sitting in an IMAX theater that curves and the pictures and quality are amazing.  I can sit for hours just watching virtual walking tours, train rides, stunning scenic tours from around the world and it is SO much more amazing than watching on the TV or computer screen.  All I can say is that I'm glad I'm retired as I would be taking off work to play with this.  I will eventually get a game or two, but for now there is so much free stuff to explore it will be a while. I even laid down on the couch and watched my favorite Netflix show in a virtual theater with a gigantic screen.  WOW.At first I was concerned that because I need readers that I wouldn't be able to you this with glasses on.  It comes with a spacer for glasses wearers and I tried it and it was very blurry!  I took off my readers and it was perfect...wow, don't need them after all. I can see everything perfectly without my readers on. So, if you have that concern, don't.  These are great and I'm sure whatever games I do purchase they will be equally great. The free demo type apps that are supplied with the Oculus are amazing in themselves for anyone never experiencing VR. Get one!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,love it!,"I ordered this last week after seeing it wouldn't be available til January 22nd and I would receive it on January 24th. It was delivered Today, January 10th. Everything was packaged well in the package. It comes with a charging cable for the headset although headset is partially charged, the two controllers each with their own AA battery already installed. To set up you just need to connect it to your wifi, then download the Oculus app and finish set up on the app. One issue I have is that Facebook is required to use this, but that's just a personal preference. I wish I could just use an Oculus account. I had only one issue connecting the headset to my phone. It didnt automatically detect so it asks for the pin that is shown in the Oculus. That code was not recognized. I entered it in a few times with no luck. I closed out of the app and went back in and it automatically detected that time. So very easy fix, easy set up. I also love that the charging cable is USB C.As far as playing, if it is fit securely and in the correct position on your head the picture is incredibly clear. The ability to cast what I'm seeing to any phone using the Oculus app is amazing. Ability to record via Oculus or on Oculus app game play is clever. It has the great feature of being able to draw your safety zone so you don't accidentally smack a wall or furniture is amazing.  You can also say you are playing stationary.My only negative is if you get motion sick, this will easily make you motion sick. I get motion sick so I have to take medicine before I can play. I only say this as a warning to those who do get motion sick."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The VR deal of the decade,"I have been into VR gaming for years now. I started with an HTC Vive back in late 2016, and never looked back. At that time, the PC VR gaming experience (both the HTC and Oculus offerings) had finally become everything that gamers had been promised since the 90’s with “The Lawnmower Man” and Nintendo’s ill-fated Virtual Boy. Although I have long preferred the HTC tracking system and hardware builds, both companies offered an experience unlike anything before them.When the time came to upgrade from my HTC Vive, I purchased a Vive Pro, and was even happier than expected with the improvements over the original. I had an almost perfect VR gaming setup, with two exceptions: price, and the fact that I was tethered to a computer with a large wire.For anyone who hasn’t experienced wired VR gaming, I promise it’s more limiting than you’d expect, especially when playing games like “Thrill of the Fight” (a must have for VR exercise) or “Pavlov.” Price is pretty self explanatory, but I will mention for the sake of comparison that I had over $3500 invested in my first two VR setups, including both headsets, the gaming PC, and peripherals.Now on to why the Oculus Quest 2 is so amazing. Aside from graphical fidelity, Oculus (aka Facebook VR) is now offering a setup that is better than the original HTC Vive setup that I had in 2016, for $300! I purchased this on release day because my Vive Pro is currently out of service due to a sensor failure, and I still need a wireless adapter to “untether” my experience. When calculating the cost of a replacement sensor and the wireless adapter, those two components ALONE cost more than the Quest 2’s entire setup. AND this setup is wireless out of the box, doesn’t require me to mount sensors on my wall, and doesn’t require constant tuning/troubleshooting of my gaming PC to ensure the best experience. You open the box, put it on, and it just works. And you never again have to worry about getting tangled up in wires.After giving this glowing review, I will admit that you will never get the graphical quality from this headset that you will get from a Vive Pro/Valve Index + a good gaming PC, but for almost all of the games that I play, the experience is better on the Quest 2 simply because of the wireless aspect. If I want to play Half Life Alyx, or any other game with incredible graphics, I’ll need to go back to the Vive, but for my daily “VR workouts,” I’ll stick with the Quest 2 and Beat Saber/Thrill of the Fight.If you are looking for your first VR headset, you’ve found it. Even if you already have a gaming PC, I would still recommend the Quest 2 and an Oculus Link cable instead of a PC based VR setup.Facebook is currently selling these at a loss to introduce VR to a new audience, and to pull hardcore Steam/Valve/HTC fans like myself into the Oculus ecosystem, and they’re doing a great job. But take advantage now, because they may not ever sell hardware this good at a price this low again."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Use it everyday for movies, games, and exercise.","This is my 3rd VR set.  I have PSVR and Rift.  I don't use those anymore.  The requirement of sensors really discourage my use.  Since sensor setup means I am fix to use the device at a particular place.  With Quest 2, now I can use VR anywhere.  The resolution is also much better than what I have.  I have an 100"" theater, but now I rather watch movie with Quest 2, the screen is much bigger.  Just like going to a Grand Theater.  Some apps can play 3D with incredible clarity.The price is right at $299.  However, to be more comfortable, you need the Elite Strap, sweat proof cover, and extended batteries.  That's easily another $100 to $200 more.  64G is enough for casual user, but if you are going to download from STREAM, sidequest, and 3D movies, than you need the 256G version."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"YES YES YES YES YES: Not perfect, but really good/great!","Ok. I had the quest that I purchased a week prior to this announced product and was a bit upset. I searched everywhere for the quest and had to by it off of the ""black"" market per se, only paid 75 over retail though.With that, this is an improvement in many things. The screen does look better. The original quest, gave me a headache to watch shows or youtube, netflix, this one, you can watch everything. The headache was part of multiple things, but the main thing is , old quest you can see pixels. The screen was...blah at best to me.The controllers feel great. My only gripe is that that the head strap should not have come on this at all. This should have been built with the elite strap and with the information that I am allowing Facebook to gather on me with this, they most definitely can afford that.Virtual desktop, with a few extra apps installed on your computer such as virtual desktop streamer, sidequest, and then your steam vr or other is SO FREAKING GREAT!!!!! 90hz playing squadrons looks MUCH better than the cable right now. My only issue thus far is attaching an xbox controller on this. The app says I am good, but it just never actually connects. Once I figure this out, I can play squadrons in my living room and that would be most austacious.Other gripe is that the face part does not block out all light...like, at ALL. This should be unacceptable. Seriously, everything that Facebook/Oculus has as an extra, minus the battery pack strap, should be what comes on this in stock form. I am loving how all the companies are going this route of taking things away (apple, iphone) and then charging extra for crap that should have come with it. Its not saving the environment and all it is doing is padding profits. Again, with the information that I HAD to allow facebook to utilize for using this device, they can afford it.Anyhow, Final: Would purchase again, would suggest this for everyone. Buy virtual desktop for 20 bucks, do the hour or two of work to get it working on your computer/laptop and have fun both with native oculus and wireless connectivity. **Cable attached does NOT give you 90hz**"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I bought 2.,"I'll start with the con since it's the big turn off for a lot of people: it requires connection to a Facebook account that is in good standing. That sucks. I hope that changes, but I don't see Facebook letting go of that anytime soon.Otherwise, this thing is amazing. I got my first one back in November (and this is my first VR experience of my own ever). I got beat saber, superhot, eleven, and In Death Unchained, and all those games are a lot of fun. The tracking is really very good. Turns out that beat saber is quite a fun game and with Oculus Move now, I can track some loose fitness goals in games. That's cool too. Battery life is very good for the way I like to play (30-45 minutes at a time) so I can do a couple of sessions over a couple of days before I have to charge again. I think it's about a two hour battery life total, maybe a bit more. The controllers are comfortable and seem to be well made. The headset isn't too heavy and the three eye-separation settings seem to cover the ranges well enough. (I'm a 3, my wife is a 1). Overall, this setup is pretty incredible value if you don't mind the facebook requirement. Definitely recommend if you know someone interested in stepping into VR. The price is perfectly well justified for it being wireless and, quite frankly, just a smooth, fun experience."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing,"I spent the better part of this year trying to track down an xbox series x with no luck, and saw this. I always wanted a vr set and figured I would get this instead. BEST DECISION EVER. No online video could ever truly capture the experience. As for this device it was super easy to set up , easy to use especially if you've played video games with a controller. Content is wide ranging from games of different types, excercise, movies and tv. I can say it enough buy this it's worth every penny."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Want to get rid of your flabby arms?,"I don't write many reviews, but I felt this one was important to write.  For all you women in your 50 plus years, who have flabby arms and no arm strength, this might be your new favorite work out!  I bought this after my sister recommended it as a good stay at home workout.  I am also a science fiction geek (think Ready Player 1) so virtual reality intrigued me.  Once I got in and started batting around the orbs flying by me it got to be quite the work out. My arms feel stronger and I can tell my arms are getting more toned every day.  I wish I had taken a before picture before I started using Oculus.  I bought Beat Saber, Audio Trip and Supernatural.  All heart pounding , sweaty work outs.  It's a good short break workout between zoom meetings with annoying issues (you hit the orbs harder and you get more points!)  The only caution I have is clearing out enough space in your house to swing your arms and dance around a bit.  Rooms with fans are not recommended.  You should also confirm where your small people and pets are before you don your Oculus.  Otherwise, very pleasantly surprised with my purchase. PS Can someone develop a VR game where I am a Viking princess slaying dragons and bad guys to 80's tunes?."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Not bad,"We were hoping to play a few games like roblox on the pc, and learned it required a pricey cord. Okay fine, we found a cheap one.Then we discovered that NONE of our computers, even our 4 year old gaming Lenovo laptop, had enough to run it.Super disappointing, but I guess we should have researched better.The graphics are pretty good and so far the two games and several demos we’ve tried out are pretty fun.I (35f) tend to get mildly motion sick when I play this, so I only do it in blips.The rollercoaster game literally made me so sick I had to lay down trying not to puke for like 30 minutes.I know. I’m pretty hardcore.Anyways, of motion sickness is a thing, try one before you buy one.I’m looking forward to buying a few  games, although I’m somewhat disappointed at the limited selection of free activities considering how pricey this thing is, but, alright, I get it.All in all it was a hit with my daughter.Not perfect, but what is."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best VR I've ever used,"I know that a lot of people hate it that Facebook is requiring a FB account to log in, but I would have expected the same thing from Apple, Microsoft or Google if they'd bought Oculus.  I really think the solution to that is that FB should let people set up a separate account with no headaches so they can separate their VR activity from their other social activity.That said, if you can live with the FB account log in requirement, WOW this is great VR.  I've got a pretty decent gaming PC and while the Link cable works just as well with the Quest2 as it does with my original Quest, where things really shine is when you buy Virtual Desktop through the Oculus store and then put SideQuest on the Quest2.  Suddenly, I'm playing games wirelessly from my PC at 90hz and I'm getting about 32ms latency (which I can't even notice and I'm a long-time gamer).  Titles that gave me a little motion sickness at 72hz give me NONE at 90hz.  I played Half Life Alyx on this thing for almost 2 hours straight and I've never been able to go more than about 45min in that game without my eyes and head hurting.  I also got the enhanced strap w/battery and finished that 2 hour session with about 60% of my battery left(!).The screen is better in every way when you're wearing it.  The screen door effect is gone, and I didn't really miss the deep OLED black pixels until I used my old one after a week of using just the new one.  Between the two, losing the screen door effect is more important than the deep blacks, but I'm looking forward to a VR screen someday that uses MicroLED and gives us the best of both worlds.  Until then, this is as good as it gets.A lot of people are talking about the HP Reverb G2, and it seems like a great headset if you don't mind being tethered to a gaming PC, but while the old Quest didn't feel that powerful, this new one with the XR2 CPU/GPU feels like it's capable of so much more than we've even seen yet.  I love that I can play great games like Robo Recall, Beat Saber, I Expect You to Die, The Climb, Red Matter and so many more without needing a PC at all, but when I want to play the super-powered games like Half Life Alyx, I can do those too, and with Virtual Desktop, I don't even need a cable(!)."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,My First VR Headset,"Let me start by saying that my first contact with VR was about 6 years ago with a demo of the original Rift, it's impressive how far technology has come in that time.The visuals are great, sure you can get much better graphics on a next gen console or gaming pc, but the experience of completely different, everyone I've shown this loves the feeling you get and are blown away by hope immersive this is, couple that work some good headphones and you really get lost in the world.If you got the chance dive in, you won't regret it, and the whole Facebook thing? Well I don't really use it much so I don't mind the mandatory requirement, let's have it Google has to a lot more on me than Facebook 😂"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best purchase ever.,"I bought this for my almost 13yo son.  Since the pandemic he hasn't been able to participate in any sports.  He was getting depressed and was very lonely.  I was hesitant to introduce yet another screen but this has been a life saver-figuratively and possibly literally.  The set up was easy. He plays for hours each day with people and I monitor the chats (you never know if there's crazy people out there).  He's physically active, visiting places all over the world, and playing all kinds of sports virtually.  The games can be pricey as well but I just assign extra chores so he can earn more money and buy the games.  Totally worth the investment."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Finally Received - Ready to Rock!,"This Oculus Quest 2 VR headset has turned the VR world on it's head and making it a true gaming console for every serious gamer. You can even watch 3D movies and get the true 3D functionality. So many things you can do besides watching a movie or 3D movies. You can play games but theirs a whole assortment of different type of games e. g., regular way to watch, immersive, 360, interactive, it's just amazing. The Oculus Quest 2 will keep you entertained for hours and you won't even realize the time spent. I had to buy a battery because the Oculus doesn't stay on long enough for me. Yes, I'm on for hours and the time goes by so fast chances are you're going to get hooked just like me. The graphics, the games, the movies, and the number of options available is by far more entertaining and makes this purchase a no-brainer. I read all the hype and I'm just another happy VR user contributing to the hype. I gave it 5 stars because it's worth every penny. Just take a look at all of the VR headsets our their and the Oculus Quest 2 is the only standalone this cheap. I also bought the HTC Vive Custom Audio Strap, more comfortable and has built-in audio phones, VR Power battery, which allows me to use my headset for up to 8 hours. Trust me, I've not come close to playing that long but I've played for more than 2 or 3 hours, a lens protector, and a stand that I can sit my headset and controllers on. The stand is easy to use and works great.I don't know what else to say about my new Oculus Quest 2 other than; if you're looking to buy a new VR headset and want to save hundreds of dollars, still get the high video resolution, powerful robust processor, and not have to connect to a computer every time you want to play, then this a no-brainer."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great headset but needs a facebook account,"I have purchased almost every oculus product, I had the dk1, dk2 ,cv1 and quest 1 now I have the quest 2 and this new headset is amazing. The visual clarity is just what I wanted, you can watch movies in vr on the vr movie theater and its just great, also you tube vr videos never looked better.The only disappointment I have is the Facebook integration,  such a pain.  I still have my quest 1 and now I need to make a second facebook account just to use it or ill get banned if I used my current facebook account, and since it will be a facebook account just for the headset facebook will probably ban it anyway, I dont think ill be buying any more facebook vr products after this unless they stop banning headsets, i think facebook made a mistake with that integration and will be their downfall unless they easy up on it. Over all its a great headset but if you have more that 1 quest you might run into some issues.Ill be looking forward for the next quest 2 challenger."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazon Thank You for coming through for me!,"OMG-AMAZON you have really, really, reallllly made my 2020 Christmas a great one!  I was so upset that the actual price ($299) Oculus Quest 2 was on back order until January.  I searched everywhere even in other countries but no avail.  So I went ahead and ordered it Sun. Dec 13th on Amazon and planned on printing the order with the picture of the Oculus Quest 2 and wrapping that so the kids knew it was coming.  Everyone knows that is not how parents want to give present to their  kids at Christmas time.  Needless to say I was pretty upset and rather sick to my stomach.  Today is Tue. Dec. 15th and I get an email saying my order has been delivered.  I think most everyone is like me this year and have been ordering multiple items through Amazon so I wasn't sure what it was.  Opening the box I see YES the Oculus Quest 2.  I was shocked, stunned and actually started to cry.  My kids will be happy and some what surprised but it won't come close to how surprised and happy I was when getting it.  Thank you so much Amazon!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This thing is 🔥🔥🔥,"So, I used to be a fairly avid gamer, but I haven't played much of anything in well over a decade. The common excuses of life, family, career, etc. certainly all apply, but TBH, the real culprit has just been lack of interest. As in ""Great, here comes another MMORPG, or shoot 'em up war / zombie FPS that's incrementally better than the last dozen that preceded it and will require another $1000 video card upgrade, 100hrs to figure out how to play, and exacerbate the RSS endemic of anyone who's spent their career in IT."" ***yawn***And then someone let me use their Oculus Quest 2 last weekend, (after which I immediately purchased one.) I haven't been awed by anything gaming related in, well... the last time was probably the first 3DFX Voodoo 1 card 25 years ago. I dunno, I tried the original Rift 5ish years ago, and while it was novel, it just didn't grab me. Maybe it was the lower resolution, or I tried the wrong titles, but the immersion wasn't there. This thing on the other hand... wow. MSFS 2020 in VR is amazing!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Facebook sucks, but the product is great","It really pains me to say it, but this is a good buy.  I've been waiting to fully get onto the VR bandwagon, and this finally made it affordable and enticing enough for me to do so.  I've heard of a lot of weird situations happening where people's accounts are getting banned simply for merging their Oculus account into it... From what I understand, a lot of their accounts are being reinstated.  Think about it... Facebook WANTS you to use the product.  They WANT you to be buying things from the store, and allowing them to harvest your sweet sweet data.  I have confidence that before long, everyone will have access again.Now, onto the specifics.-This is first and foremost a standalone system, which is great.  The ability to play in any room of the house without bothering other people is huge.  The native software catalog isn't huge yet, but I'm sure that it'll continue to expand.-You can get a HELL of a workout with this thing.  I'm at a point in my life where I would rather have bamboo chutes jammed under my fingernails than walk on the treadmill, so making exercise fun again was a godsend.  I feel better and better every day, and I'm losing weight.  I tell people: remember how when you were a little kid, you would run around on the playground all day?  It wasn't necessarily that you had killer cardio, its that you were having so much fun that you didn't even care that you felt like your lungs were on fire.  That's how this is.  Notable games for this: ""Beat Saber"" and ""Pistol Whip"".-For PC gaming, this isn't completely there yet.  The Oculus Link is still in beta, and the only other option is an app called ""Virtual Desktop"" which allows you to pair your device to your PC over WiFi.  I have a top-of-the-line gaming PC and 5GHz WiFi router... neither of these options are spectacular yet.  With Oculus Link, the positions of the controllers seems to stutter and lag occasionally.  It doesn't make anything unplayable, but it is just enough to throw off your groove in a rhythm game.  With Virtual Desktop, I consistently have issues where the virtual world's rendering seems to lag behind my head movement; whipping my head to the side leaves me briefly looking into a black screen until the PC/WiFi catch up and show me what is actually supposed to be there.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  It fits perfectly with my lifestyle, and it makes me FEEL BETTER."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Grandma Likes!,"So I'm not a Gamer of any kind but I've been wanting one for a long time and I'm not getting any younger so I indulged myself and bought the Q2 and it just arrived. I'm a 45 year old woman with an awesome looking gaming setup in my office and all I needed was the games and really.. where has this been all my life??? I'm in love!The picture is downright amazing and it feels so real! It comes with a mind-blowing list of games & programs to choose from, and many are FREE. I can't imagine even wanting any other game aside from this. My daughter has PS4 with all the popular games and just this morning she was bragging on how much better PS4 is than the Q2 and I just watched her face crumble when she tried my Q2 out because she suddenly realized that her game isn't as good as it gets lol.If you are an avid Gamer, or someone like me who just wanted a ""toy"" you will love it. You can even purchase fitness & meditation programs, virtual office meetings, games, free movie & sports channels, concerts.. it's endless options!!!No trouble with mine, it's as smooth as it gets but I did order the optional 16 ft PC adapter cord so I can use it on the PC but you can use it on your cell phone by downloading an app, it's overall pretty easy to figure out and fun to use. You can't go wrong with this one and the kids & grandkids are going to have a lot of fun with it too.ONLY DOWNSIDE I CAN FIND: Once you hook it up to an account that's it. You cannot load multiple accounts with this one. We connected it to my daughter's acct. to try it out and now it will not allow me my own account. Sooo..  she kind of just got forced into buying one for me now but that's okay, she wanted one of her own anyway and was going to buy it but not this soon so we are ordering today lol.*If this review helped you in any way could you please let me know by voting it Helpful? Reviews are my passion and I love sharing my experiences with the products I purchase so you can make an informed choice. Thanks!*"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This is a no-brainer.,"Just a quick look at the specs and the price are enough to know that this is an incredible deal, but nothing prepares you for the experience itself. I upgraded to the Quest 2 from the Vive Pro, which cost me more than 3 times as much as the Quest 2, and the former wipes the floor with the latter. What very minimal screen-door effect there is is so slight that it is quickly ignored by the brain - something impossible with lower resolution or OLED screens, so immersion is on another level to previous generations of headset. This immersion will be further enhanced by apps supporting the controller-free hand-tracking mode, which literally brings your hands into VR. The forthcoming Infinite Office's ability to similarly bring a physical keyboard into VR will hopefully be extended to support keyboards other than the Logitech K830 demonstrated so far."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Immersive, lots of fun entertainment, worth the price.","A very versatile device. You connect it to your Facebook account and wifi immediately upon setup. No manual required as the device gives you easy directions. The device has cameras which allows hand tracking (aka a controller-free experience for browsing).This transports you to a different world. It has fun workout and dance games, shooting and fighting, mind blowing meditation (it transports you to beautiful lakes, mountains, hypnotic patterns, and really calms you down). It provides a great escape, especially during the horrible times the world is going through right now. It eases my symptoms of depression.I will start off by saying battery life is terrible but you can play while having the cable plugged in! For me though I also use headphones in the device and because my charging cable is L shaped, I cannot use the device with both headphone cable and charging cable plugged in, either one or the other. There's no bluetooth.COMFORT:I wear these over glasses and it's fine. I used a YouTube video to figure out how to adjust the straps LOL cause my first attempts were not working and the set kept sliding off. You can push the eye viewers quite far apart. The tighter and higher the headset sits, the less blurry the view will be.PICTURE QUALITY/GRAPHICS:Some apps have much better picture quality than others. For super crisp HD everywhere, you can get that with much more expensive models or perhaps if you connected this to PC. The field of view (aka range of vision) is quite limited. You mainly see what's right in front of you at first glance of the landscape but of course you can spin around and see more. However if you want a significantly larger field of view, those are usually in PC-only devices and hundreds of more dollars. This is easily worth its price. It is very immersive regardless and convenient. It is more immersive if you're standing up as opposed to sitting down.Netflix and YouTube were fairly clear. Theyre not blurry. However for Netflix, you will get a more crisp HD picture watching it with your laptop or phone.ENTERTAINMENT:You can customize your home screen from being in a dome to a cyberpunk city for free.. To get the most out of entertainment, use high end headphones for surround sound because the headset provides lackluster sound. Also the best apps cost money but are definitely worth it! I've tried out Creed and you genuinely feel like you're fighting in a boxing ring. Beat Saber (arguably the most toted Vr Oculus game) graphics are solid. Superhot VR is pretty sick! You feel like a super spy fully in control as you dodge bullets, punch the enemies, and have to manage to grab a weapon at the same time.YouTube video experiences are significantly enhanced because the viewing screen is huge (and adjustable), whether it's a VR video or not. So it can feel like you're in a movie theater. The Netflix app is cute because your surroundings change to a large home with a cute coffee table and a large movie screen once you pick a selection.MOTION SICKNESS:I am prone to motion sickness but this device doesn't bother me often. The most I usually sit through is a little over 1 hour. Note, you will get motion sickness more from some games than others. Of course from Rollercoaster games, you will get some motion sickness. I didn't get this from workout games, sword fighting games, or TV/ movie apps.I used both Netflix and YouTube on this.  I got no motion sickness from these apps.Overall:Much happier than I expected. I've tried several headsets where you put your phone in it and it's not immersive at all and they seemed like a waste of money. I genuinely want to feel like I'm in another world and this device does that. Like I said if you want even more of a view, there's super high end devices but they're likely not as convenient as this one!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"A few things to know before buying, but....","1. You need a facebook account  and a smartphone to use this. If this is a deal breaker, I suggest getting an Oculus Rift S and a VR capable PC.2. Many apps  do not support cross buy, meaning  if you own oculus apps through the PC Oculus App for the rift, odds are you will need to purchase your content a second time. This would have been nice to know in advance, but wasn't  a deal breaker.3. If you are an adult really want a good long term experience for yourself, i do not suggest considering the price tag listed as the final price for a comfortable product.  There are multiple accesories you will want to buy as well.Audio: The integrated audio is not great for anything with bass, and lacks immersion (though it does allow you to hear your surrounding). After testing multiple audio solutions, the HTC Vive's deluxe audio strap solves not only this issue, but also is a better product overall than the elite strap or the knock offs of the elite strap. If you want to go this route and have a comfortable strap plus great audio, you will also want to get the Frankenquest 2 adapters from business company VR (not available on amazon). I have tried multiple adapters and these work the best. If you want a case for the headset and controllers  and you do go this route, get the case for the HTC Vive Cosmos, it actually fits with the headphones and fits the controllers  as well. Finally, the foam for the head strap is absorbent, so i do suggest ordering a hygeinic head strap replacement foam from VR COVER, it is hygeinic as it can easily be wiped off and won't absorb sweat. This doesn't  only apply to those playing fast paced workout games.Controllers: You may want more comfortable  grips for the controllers, anything with the words ""Anti throw"" will provide a more convenient strap so your controllers stay with you without having to tie straps around your wrists. You will also want rechargeable batteries, as the controllers use up a lot of juice.Headset: Most important accesory for the headset is a hygeinic facial interface, anything but standar foam or silicone. The standard foam absorbs sweat, and the silicone is very uncomfortable to have your face squeezed against for even five minutes. There are many silicone  covers for the headset itself. I recommend getting one as it is cheap and will protect the headset in the case of an accident. On this same note, some lens protectors are advised. There are silicone  rings that protect the lens from scratches (in case you or someone who you know wears glasses). There are also foam protectors for your lens for under $10 (for when the headset is not in use). All of these items can be found on amazon for very cheap.Overall, even if you get all of the accessories I listed, the product will still be cheaper  than getting a desktop VR headset  and a PC capable of driving it. If you like the freedom of being untethered by wires, this is an excellent purchase. The field of view is maybe 10% worse than the Oculus Rift S, but nothing I'd  get too upset over  at this price point.One final note is about charging and using power banks. I do not recommend having the device plugged  into anything other than a computer while being used. With Oculus Air Link, you shouldn't  even need to do that at any point either. The risk of long term damage to the headset by charging the device while using it is too great to justify. Honestly, 2 hours of use is plenty if you are conscious of your health. To me, this is better to accept than to try and work around. For others it could be worth the risk, but not to me."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oh heck yes!,"I was worried when i bought this that I would stop using it.  I thought it would be a novelty that i picked up once in a while.But i was wrong.  I use it every day.It's not the most comfortable thing you'll ever strap on your head but the experience is really good. The games are super fun and other things too.  I enjoy drawing and designing and there's good apps like gravity sketch that let me be super creative in a virtual space.It's a winner.  Be prepared to spend money on apps and accessories.  I didn't need the carrying case. It's fine just sitting on a dresser to charge.  I have more comfortable eye padding.  Apps are more expensive than on a phone.  Some can be around $20.  They have a ""return period"" though if you don't like them."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Amazing, except for the Facebook parts","The Quest 2 is a great VR headset. You can use it by itself (no computer required) or you can connect it to a pc if you have one.Being able to play wirelessly with just the headset or a pc is so great, especially for action games where you’re moving around a lot. Once you go wireless, you'll never want to use a wire again.There's a built in ""guardian"" that stops you from running into things, a grid will appear when you get too close to something. Works great.Pro tip: buy a small circular rug to put in the center of your play area, it helps give you a sense of where you are in your room. This prevents you from thinking you’re gonna run into something and gives you a home point that you can return to by feel. There's even ones made specifically for VR on Amazon that have little bumps so you can find out what direction you're facing, but I just went with a simple cheap circular rug.There’s a decent selection of games, enough to keep you occupied and interested and the ability to connect it to a pc means you can play pretty much anything. Some of my favorites that run directly on the quest are Superhot VR, Gorn, Pavlov Shack, Labmda1VR (Half Life 1 in VR!!!), and of course Beat Saber.Only downside is the forced Facebook integration and ads FB is planning to add, but that’s the reason the price is so low so I can’t complain much. Though, the ability to use FB Messenger is pretty useful for talking to friends in the headset. You can also live stream games directly to Facebook so your friends can watch you play, and it saves the video on your account afterwards. Sadly there’s no Twitch or YouTube streaming :(Overall this is a great headset and I’m glad to own one. If you’re considering, just buy it already. you won’t regret it!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Love it!,So far I’m loving my new quest 2. It’s smaller and lighter than my old quest and I ordered with the Elite Strap which is amazing btw in terms of comfort compared to the OG quest it’s soooo much better by leaps and bounds trust me you don’t need to buy the elite strap with battery pack unless you want to charge it for extra playing time but if it’s just for comfort the regular $50 elite strap is amazing no more VR face! I can play with comfort for a long time without getting those ugly marks on my face also I was thinking I would need a VR cover but the stock one is perfect! Also it turns on much faster and everything loads much easier it’s definitely worth it and I already had a FB account so that’s never been an issue for me I got nothing to hide! Also with the elite strap you can loosen up the black strap on top so it doesn’t even touch your hair which is awesome if you got styled hair or what not no more squashed up VR hair lol
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Oh man, yes....","Since I had been unable to buy a PS5 I thought I'd give this a try. The price was right and honestly I was not expecting it to be this good and the updates keep making it better.I'd been wanting to play Beat Saber FOREVER and it does not disappoint.I'm definitely crediting exercise games like Fit XR and Supernatural (there IS a subscription, but...) for giving me more options for my workouts and helping to keep me consistent with my whole workout routine...The games are amazing for the most part, I'm usually motion sensitive and havent had any issues with the majority of games, tho you do have to get used to that sense of standing up high or in the middle of nothing sometimes. The game where you 'float' instead of move yourself around are the ones that mess with my head the most, but there are only a couple of those I'm still trying to work through...Overall, if you're going to buy this get the 256 Gig model...they've recently added the virtual desktop wireless feature that lets you connect to your PC and stream from Steam, which is pretty darned cool since they have a bunch more games ( tho i recommend buying games on Oculus if you can, it's just a better experience)..they've got a lot more updates coming that are only going to make this more awesomer!...lol...Now if they can just get developers to do games like Pokemon, Magic, Avengers...some of these really immersive...and they dont have kicking..yet...there was one game i saw in development that was essentially fight club, you vs someone else and with your own fight style...which sounds appealing...lol..."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,So worth it!!! You gotta try it!!!,I love this! This is my first VR I'm happy with the price I'm happy with the experience. I'm currently sharing it with my son who's about to be 10 so I guess I'm about to buy another one because I don't want to share with him it's awesome. And the games don't really cross that much they're comparable with in price to any game that I would buy him on a PlayStation it's great I recommend it to all my friends. Usually after they try it they buy it. By the way I'm 53 a mother and a grandmother and this is an awesome device I do not regret buying it and you're never too over to play.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best technological buy probably of my life.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   If you’re debating on whether or not to get this or a switch or something. Get this. You won't be disappointed. I have a very nice gaming pc and have a very nice high refresh monitor, so some would say I enjoy the finer things in life. This my friend is the next step in gaming or even just immersion into what we have come to in our generation now. Completely blown away. I got the lower 64GB version expecting to rely more on my pc but boy was I wrong. It’s more powerful then I could have imagined and if you don’t have a powerful pc like me and want the vr experience alone with a lot of perks that other headsets don’t havego ahead and get it. Very very happy happy with what I received, even after watching numerous videos I could never have been ready for what this shows you technology has come to.Ps: hilarious when you show other (older)people, literally the home menus and are completely blown away like you were. Tears."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,NEED FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! WILL NOT WORK WITH OUT ONE!,"Awesome all in one system and the graphics i think personally are better on the Quest 2 than PSVR and original Quest.Works well linked to my CPU to play steam VR games as well as mirror my cpu into the goggles too. After upgrading the display on the one site, the graphics are a bit sharper and refresh rate makes a difference (Look up online how to do it)  I just wish the battery life was a lot longer than 2 hours and recommend the external battery to strap to it if you do not have a long USB-C to USB charger or Oculus Link Cable to keep it plugged in. But you should not be using them for longer than a hour at a time as an adult anyway. The only thing I wish they would do is add more space shooters to its game line up but thanks to Steam VR and other oculus apps that mirror your CPU to the goggles, it keeps me going.Recommend getting the Oculus grips and covers along with the elite strap for the goggles itslef for comfort and protection because it is not cheap to replace the remotes if you break them whacking the wall or the ceiling when you start getting excited.Side Note:its $100 more for almost triple the memory and Black color, but i have not ran into a memory issue with the 20 apps and games i have downloaded onto it with the $299 model. Except when i use the DJ app and download mp3 music onto it for the turntables.Worth the money and find myself playing it twice as much as I do my new Xbox series X console do to being able to take it on trips and watch movies in bed while not interrupting my GF when she is sleeping lol."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Absolutely recommend this product,"Most amazing VR experience to date. The performance of the product for the consumer scale is outstanding. Have used with the Oculus store games and on Steam. Performs amazingly if the setup and environment arrangements are done properly. Be sure your lighting is adequate. Also, be sure when using Steam or connecting to your computer with the Oculus Link cable (not included) that you log have the Oculus software downloaded and installed (may take a while to download) and that you enable the Oculus Link cable when the prompt pulls up, otherwise you have to unplug the cable from the headset and plug it back in to get the prompt to pop back up. Main thing is to take the time to do things properly and you won't be disappointed in the product. Performance wise, this is a phenomenal headset for a decent price. Also, I definitely see alot of value in the inward out tracking as opposed to systems that go outward in. Movement is very fluid without any latency. Hand controls are intuitive and work well with the in game functions. Feels like a second set of hands after you.are used to how to navigate them. Be sure to use the straps for the controllers. They will save you from accidentally throwing them. Screen resolution is amazing and the colors are on point. Highly recommend. Only downside is you must link a Facebook account. Just take the time during setup to block the access that you don't want to permit. Of course storage must be allowed in order for it to function and run games. Be sure to set your sharing parameters as well in regards to your Facebook information, same as you would choose on the Facebook app. Overall it has not disappointed."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Not a fan of Facebook, but the Quest 2 is great in spite of it.","I needed developer more on to play Beatsaber correctly. Which meant attaching an actual Facebook account to it instead of my Quest account. This led to some issues with the wrong account getting associated and my entire purchase library disappearing, but the Oculus support team was quick in assisting me to get it all working again. They didn't care that my Facebook account had been disabled for nearly 12 years now since I don't use social media. All my browsers are full of anti-script to stop the data mining, and even after the scrutiny of their support, they didn't seem to mind the abnormality of my account. All these negative aspects listed in these reviews are mostly theoretical and didn't even happen to the people using them. It's annoying that I'm supporting Facebook by using the headset (Oculus selling out to Facebook of all companies was a shot in the face), and still this device performs so well for its price point that I'm highly satisfied with my purchase. 99% of the time I'm using using it for modded Beatsaber (which Facebook now also owns...) having to use the unauthorized BMBF program to download mods and custom songs, and Facebook has left my account intact.If in a few years when it comes time to replace this Quest 2 comes out at a similar price point and quality, I'm ditching the Facebook riddled Quest asap. But for now, the Oculus team is doing a great job. Recent additions to developer mode are going to make this device even better when they become part of the public build, too.And as a side node, the 64gb model may seem like not enough space in 2021, but with the requirements on the size of official content, it's plenty enough for almost everyone but developers. I do, also, HIGHLY recommend the Elite Strap (or one of the cheaper knockoffs) because the default strap is terrible even if you don't know what you're missing. Spend the $40 on the Elite Strap and you won't regret it, it's better in so many ways. Especially if you have long hair."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Quest 2 Was Worth the Wait,"My family has been interested in VR for a while and I'm lucky enough to be able to demo the different hardware that's come out at work.  It's all been really cool but not yet ready to invest in purchasing a unit for my home and family until now.  Quest 2 256GB exceeding my expectations so far.  Had it for about a month and have mostly played DrunkNBarfight and Beat Saber so far. Love the games and you end up working up a sweat which is a nice bonus. I was not expecting to be able to get some limited exercise while playing the games but you really do!  The games load quickly, it has a great tutorial to learn, and it's cool connecting with your friends to play a game together.  It does a great job of creating a safe virtual space to play in.  Fit is comfortable but you have to fidget with some things when you swap the headset with another person.  Battery lasts over 2 hours of full play. Hasn't run out on us yet.  I'm super impressed with the hand held controllers. the haptic feedback is impressive and they work really well.A few suggestions:> It was hard to get the games to cast to my TV - I'm on a mesh network and I think that was part of the issue. Figured it out but it took a few hours of research and trail and error.> It's hard to find your ""games"" on the home screen. They are a few clicks away sometimes.  Oculus seems more focused on showing you what to buy than letting you jump right in.> They shouldn't require a Facebook account to use Oculus.  It's convenient because you can easily reach friends to play with and I would do it even if it was optional but it's the wrong kind of thinking by Facebook. This is why they will eventually broken up as a ""monopoly"".  I don't care because I'm on Facebook but it was a really short sighted decision by the people who made this amazing hardware. If you've been waiting to get VR this is the model to buy!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best of the best,"Nothing more to add than the other thousand reviews there.Quality is very premium, motion tracking using the controllers or hands is out of this world. Can't believe we live in times like these. I wonder where this will take us and I sometimes get worries we will be too immersed and forget real life , like Ready Player One.One thing I hope can be helpful to people, is that if you do not have a large free space, expect not to enjoy this as much.I was so excited to play with the VR when I bought it, but after a few days I was not using it anymore and I thought maybe this is just not for me. But when I took it to my father in law's place, and used it there (They have a big place) , man, the experience was much more immersive. Made me want to stay there for a few days so I can properly enjoy the games, eleven VR for example was one of the games that requires large room space."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Totally Awesome = 5 Stars !,"I wasn't sure about this VR for quite awhile because of the Facebook requirement thingy because at the time, I didn't have FB. After reading the reviews and watching tons of YouTube videos about this device, I decided to just go for it.It was easy to set up and the FB situation wasn't as bad as I had thought it would  be. I opened up a FB account and that's it. I have not had any issues with FB nor the VR itself.  I have purchased a few apps and even requested a refund for one app and that process was smooth and simple. The VR is a world of it's own.  The realness of objects is so nice and immersed.Things really do appear realistic and the VR is lightweight.  I can add, transfer media to and from it...it connects seemingly with my laptop and it like a regular PC that rests on your face...lol. I went ahead and purchased a cover for the headset and grips for protection from dirt, scrapes and scratches.I love it and would recommend it. Don't let the FB requirement thing sway you away because if you think about...other Internet and Tech firms require the same things in order to use their services and products...ie Google...Amazon Alexa/Echo devices. I haven't had any issues whatsoever with FB so for me to sign up just recently says allot. Thanks !"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best VR headset I have ever owned!!,"Okay, full disclaimer it is the only VR headset I have ever owned. That being said it was a great birthday present to myself and I love every minute I use it.Okay so for the bad things about it. The head strap is horrible, very uncomfortable and I find myself rearranging it very often. And the elite head strap is rather costly at the moment. There is limited content at the moment which kind of sucks. You have different things such as Venues which is in beta that has some good potential but falls flat at times. But maybe soon we will have some cool things VR dating sites especially with current events. And more games, imagine top games like an actual VR COD or GTA. And what about games like Among us but in full VR mode. And maybe some VR vacations where we can go to actual places and walk the streets and go into the stores on our own and not some video tour we watch. And maybe with movie theaters going away we can watch more VR160 formatted Hollywood hits. Like I said the potential is limitless and maybe in a few years it will be huge.Another thing I do not care of is the fact that you can not use Bluetooth headsets unless you do some technical stuff that takes some know how and work. Instead it uses a standard headphone jack, so not cool. But the built in speaker system is very good.And it doesn't charge very fast while plugged in and using it. So you battery will still drain just not as fast and it wont fully recharge if you are using it. At least that has been my experience. But the battery does last several hours so it is good and it doesn't take long to fully recharge when it is off.The last thing I hate and a lot of people say it, sometimes it isn't very clear. There is some video that comes out blurry and you have to adjust the headset to get a clearer picture. But honestly for the most part everything else is clear so it isn't that big of a deal.Now the positives.It is just so darn fun!!! Plus a lot of the games are good for getting that exercise and movement. So if you have a kid who loves games but doesn't like to go outside and move around get him one of these, set up the parental controls and watch them get healthy.Also with the cast feature you can actually see what the kids are doing on the the VR headset right on your cellphone with the Oculus app.Plus you can surf the web, watch youtube, movies, amazon prime and Netflix on this headset so you can lay in bed watch a movie in all sort of settings. And the screens look huge so it is like having a 100 foot television.While there is limited content currently you can still do a lot from watching movies, to seeing concerts and chatting with people all over the world. So it isn't just playing games. Plus the learning capabilities are endless in the VR world. One day we can use it to go to school and get degrees. Learn hands on skills without having to leave our homes.Overall, this VR headset is amazing and a very worthwhile investment. Best money I ever spent on myself!!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I HAVE OWNED EVERY OCULUS HEADSET AND THIS IS THE BEST!!!,"I HAVE OWNED THE RIFT, RIFT S, AND THE ORIGINAL QUEST. This Quest 2 is by far the best out of them all. I have the $1500 computers to run the “higher end” headsets and I sold all of them after playing this headset. I am very picky when it comes to my VR experience and I just am beside myself...this is the wireless headset that we have been waiting for. If you love VR but don’t have the time to setup sensors or hate running wires everywhere, BUY BUY BUY!! The graphics and stability are much better than any Oculus headset out, the multiplayer games are phenomenal. The only possible thing I can say is that the rift S is very comfortable. The quest 2 is comfortable and doesn’t pose an issue, however it is not quite as plush as the rift S. Nonetheless DO NOT BUY the rift S....this thing blows it out of the water in almost every category."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,No video review can prepare you for this.,It is just awesome. I mean you really can just look all around you. And the audio is insanely in tune and directed at your ears in a way that just feels so natural. The rollercoaster app makes me a bit sick to my stomach. They say if you get motion sickness try dramamine. But I am a hermit and never go out. I hate crowds. But with this I can watch shows and feel apart of something knowing I am safe at home. I am excited to keep exploring vr and trying new things. Oh and if you are having trouble casting to your pc get the AirReciever app from the microsoft store. it is like $3 but it works great. My kids love it too. I can not wait to sideload minecraft and pokemon on it for them to check out.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Steam issue & Link issue,"This is almost a perfect product. But I had a steam issue right out of the box. I contacted Oculus and they said I should buy anti-fogging spray to stop the fogging.  So to get around the design problem be prepared to shell out for  anti-fog spray or wipes. I eventually got a silicone protector with a nose guard and I no longer have the problem. It would have been nice to have that from the start, like the PSVR headset.I ordered a suitable oculus link USB-C cable for $30 and got the oculus link working. The biggest challenge was the AMD GPU drivers. The latest drivers prevented the oculus link working. I thought it was a problem with the cable - but no - it was the drivers all along. Spent hours on this issue...  so if you have this issue - roll back the AMD GPU drivers (search the web for full solution).This is a great product though and so glad I ordered it. It gave me headaches at first - but I got used to it now. It is like having two products - the wireless Quest mode and the Rift mode - which works with a host of PC applications.I am so happy with the performance in HL Alex and other steam games.  The Quest 2 games are also great and I am a big fan of the wireless experience. I also love the way I can buy the Rift version of a game and also get the Quest version (or the other way around). Google VR is mind blowing. Some of the fitness apps really get me sweating.The strap is ok. There are videos on how to get this right. I am sure the elite strap is great - but good luck finding it in stock. I also don't feel like paying another $50.  With the drawbacks I would give 4.6 stars - but there is nothing else like it on the market and there is so much you can do with this thing - so I will give it a full 5 stars. Would love for all my family to get one so we can all meet up in the cloud and chat..."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Insane Price, Fully Wireless, Good Performance","A piece of advice: First of all, you don't need an ""Oculus Link"" cable, any USB type-c is fine. Secondly, unless your PC is not good, you probably only need the $300 version. 64Gb is plenty since the games you'll want to store *on* the oculus are probably going to be smaller simpler, more arcadey games, and you'll put big games on your PC to stream to Oculus using a cable or Virtual Desktop.The best thing: Much more convenient to use than any other VR set due to being fully wireless & self-contained.The worst thing: Requires a facebook account to use (you can make your name, activity, and profile private but it still kinda sucks).Its fully wireless and you don't have to set up anything in the room, which for me was a requirement for me to buy a VR headset. The screen runs at up to 120hz which is awesome. It has its own memory and processor so you can run games (including online games) without using your PC at all. This makes the time to get into a game very short, which is awesome. If you want to play taxing games, or games with Steam Workshop, you can get an app called Virtual Desktop and stream the games wirelessly from PC to oculus (Oculus also has a similar app, but it is not as good as Virtual Destop at this time). Alternatively you can plug your oculus into your PC directly with any USB type-c cable."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awesome for PCVR or light gaming,"Right out of the box I knew this was something special, the haptics on the controllers are tight and you can set up a virtual boundary wherever you’re playing and see the outside world while the headset is on. I don’t know if most have that, but the PSVR that I’m coming from didn’t. The tracking and clarity are quite excellent and I never have any drifting and very rarely have I lost a controller on screen, and it came back immediately.Using a USB-C cord connected to my computer opens up access to any PCVR game I want, and I’m having a lot of fun. There’s also an app you can buy that lets you play wireless PCVR and it works pretty well even on more intensive games.I’d never tried a $1000 headset but if someone told me that’s how much it cost and let me try it I might believe them. I’m thrilled with my purchase, especially at the price point, if they keep offering hardware of this quality and price I’m pretty sure more people will be able to migrate to VR.Yes you need a Facebook account to log in, but I’ve had one since they started so it wasn’t an issue for me, even though I don’t maintain it or use it.Really happy with the comfort of it, as well. A soft but firm foam and decent fabric straps hold the device comfortably on my head. When I first was playing I’d tightened it like crazy and it hurt and made me feel bad, I’ve since gotten it looser to a sweet spot where I’m barely aware of the headset until I sweat/itch and can’t reach it because of the hardware.Great device not nearly as cheap and low tech as I anticipated. I’ve yet to hit any real limitations with it paired with my PC, so that’s a great feeling."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,GREAT HEADSET AMAZING PRICE,"This headset is great. Is lightweight. Is comfortable it allows you to run any kind of VR experience, exercise and enjoy games, videos, experiences and explore like you never had before. This beats any console like Playstation or Xbox. You buy this headset and you need nothing else.PROs:-(WIRELESS)Needs no cable connected to anything but has the option to connect the cable if you want to play more graphically rich or intense games.- (COMFORT)It is far more comfortable that is predecessor. Is great for both child and adult content.-(EXPERIENCES)If you are not looking for games and are interested in exploring watching videos and seeing something knew. Get this! The experiences are amazing.-(GAMES)The are tons of great games. If you like Shooters get Onward or Pavlov. If you like fitness get CREED or Thrill of the Fight. If you want Battle Royal Population ONE. There is a ton of great content in the library.-(FITNESS)Some games are a full workout but even the ones that are not will keep you active which is far better than any other console experience where you are not using your body. Good games are CREED Multiplayer fitness and thrill of the fight.-(FRIENDS AND FAMILY)Connect in this virtual experiences with other friends and family even if they don't have a VR headset you can show it to them and pass it around for fun for everyone. If they have a VR headset too then even better you can interact with them while being distant and connect like is not possible in traditional videogames or even videocalls.-(PORTABILITY)This is a stand alone headset kind of like a phone, it is small, light and easy to put on. You can take it on the road with you.CONs:- (FACEBOOK ACCOUNT REQUIRED)This means you have to make a facebook account even if you not planning on posting anything or using it at all. Your profile will not be shared publicly unless you choose to. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't because Facebook has a garbage Term of Services that lets them ban your account for dumb things like using an Alias or having multiple accounts or sometimes for no apparent reason.-(STRAP)You have to get the 50$ strap is way better than the original one and is totally worth it. But even the 50$ strap could be far more comfortable. They need to put more work into the straps.-(WEIGHT)They reduced the weight but they need to reduce it further or have the option to remove the battery. When you walk outside the Boundaries it goes black fairly quickly this is not helpful if you want to pause to get water without taking off the headset."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Even with the extra purchases needed, a fantastic VR headset for a fraction of the cost","Upgraded from an oculus cv 1 and I couldn't be happier. The visual clarity is astounding, the standalone gaming ability is better than expected, and the pc link works very well. The Guardian setup is an absolute breeze and being able to pass through to grab a drink, etc? Worth the upgrade aloneGiven the low price, I can't complain about a few things, but they're still worth noting.First you need a Facebook account. Not a big deal for most of us, but earth shattering and a deal breaker for some so it's worth the first spot.The strap and facial interface work well but benefit greatly from some upgrades. Vrcover for the interface, halo strap the other. The vr cover will stop you from getting O Face from playing, and the halo strap will shift the weight from your face to the top of your head. The weight shift is the biggest comfort upgrade, but the facial interface replacement shouldn't be forgotten.The built in speakers are surprisingly good. I can see using them in some situations, notably when I've got a friend or family member in there. Bass is a little light. However, for personal use and sound intense sessions, headphones are pretty much required. I really like the Logitech solution. Not only are they solid in ear buds, but they made special considerations for wire lengths.And lastly, let's talk battery life and charging solutions.The battery life leaves a bit to be desired. You should get about 2 hours of playtime on a full charge, possibly less if it's a Wi-Fi intensive game. There are two reasonable solutions. First is to get some power banks. I have some 10,000 mah ankers that work great. With a 5-6ft usb cord I can clip it to my belt or drop it in my pocket and I am ready to wander wherever. For media consumption, and seated games like fishing, puzzlers, pinball, etc I've found a good pd rated charger and a long usb c cable to be the way to go.Just be sure you use an all usb c solution. Using an usb A to C adaptor, or a plug with an A side on it, you're not going to get the full power the device wants. A ""pd"" rating (Similar to the different QC ratings) SEEMS to be a solid indicator. I dunno if the q2 uses the standard, but cables and chargers that support the pd standard give me the desired charging performance.10/10 would recommend, just with some extra accessories (halo strap, vr cover, long ass charging cable, headphones)"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The best standalone and PC VR choice.,"The best priced headset for standalone or dedicated PC VR, it does both and does them both well.I bought this with the intention of using it mostly for PC VR, which it still is used for and likely will always be it's major use. However, there are some truly awesome standalone titles in the Oculus store. Theres a handful of great free to own/play games and experiences too. My one gripe is that the head strap is pretty much crap attached to an awesome VR headset. I'd reccomend buying a better engineered aftermarket one for major comfort improvements.Some people complain that the stock facial interface feels like sandpaper on their face. I've not felt this as I bought a silicone cover kit which also includes a silicone facial interface cover. Just a heads-up for anyone with sensitive skin or people prone to face irritation.PS. This is by far a much better experiance when using the headset for a dedicated PC VR game, but there are amazing titles on the Oculus store. Just be aware there are also some stripped down version if PC VR games. So, if you own a VR capable PC, look to see if it's worth getting a prettier version of the game for PC than Oculus where you think visuals matter."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This thing!!! OMG!!! I LOVE IT!,"We have had this guy for a while now and love it so much.  It has some mild issues like battery life and some extremely minor tracking issues, but I think that is just because we grab the headset cover and smudge the cameras to much.  The battery life thing is a catch 22, on home hand, it keeps you from wasting your life away gaming.  On the other hand, sometimes that is exactly what you want to do!  I works great with an extra long charging cable and you can even use a portable backup charger to extend its life too.  I use an Anker power brick when I want to go the distance.  The updates have been great so far, with new features added every time.  The latest, Multi-User accounts, is the one I have been waiting on and I am so stoked it finally dropped.  Not all the games have merged over to shareable just yet, but hopefully, in the near future, they will be.  It is great for isolation workouts, hanging out with friends virtually, or just visiting places you have never been to.  If you are looking for a great way to get into VR, this is the very best!  Go for the larger hard drive.  You never know what you will want to add and, yes, it can be linked to your pc if you want more content then what Quest has to offer.  All in all, just get it!! You will not be disappointed!!!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It's pretty fabulous!,"I had previous exposure to virtual reality (VR) with the Oculus Go at a local library and was impressed with the illusion of 3D immersion. I was never particularly interested in gaming consoles like XBox, PlayStation, or Wii.During our current sheltering in place, the facility where I was regularly playing ping pong/table tennis closed. Coincidentally I was hearing about the release of Oculus Quest 2 in October and that there was a program called Eleven for playing VR ping pong. This was the motivating factor behind my decision to purchase the Quest 2. Eleven is engaging enough that I can work up a film of sweat while playing and, in the absence of the real thing, I'm really enjoying it. Note: Eleven requires a minimum of 6.5' x 6.5' feet of clear space to play.If you're thinking of jumping into the VR experience, Quest 2 provides a solid introduction. Setup is very easy using the Oculus mobile app. Unlike the Oculus Rift which needs to be tethered to a computer, after setting it up, the Quest 2 is completely stand-alone.In addition to programs that are available for purchase, Quest 2 provides access to a lot of free content including programs that are handy for getting used to the VR environment, and VR videos that use 3D immersion technology. Many of the videos fall short of the resolution provided by HD or 4K TV but again, the illusion of immersion more than makes up for that.After a few rousing games of ping pong in Eleven, I'll sit down to cool off and let myself be amazed by the other VR experiences that Quest 2 offers. It's pretty fabulous!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,VR over wifi! Amazing!,"At first I couldn't get it to sync with my phone even though I had the latest Oculus app. Someone suggested deleting it and installing it again. After that it showed the Quest 2 as an option under ""Pair New Headset"".Just played Half Life Alyx streaming over wifi using Virtual Desktop. Amazing!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It will take time to get used to it,"I upgraded from quest 1 and there are many things that are different. The most irritating part for me is that the controlles are not as comfortable as quest 1. I play a lot of beat saber at expect+ levels so I immediately noticed that the controlles are not as accurate as the first generations. I missed a few notes that I usually don't miss. Additionally, controlles are too bulky for my hands and the home button is usually where I rest my thumb so I frequently touch the wrong buttons. It definitely will take me some time to get used to it. Hope future software updates can help increase the tracking accuracy.Other than that, the graphics are definitely better. Images are sharper and there are fixed ipd positions so never have to worry about the annoying ipd sign pop up during beat saber again."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Better than the first, and an incredibile experience for the newbie","Lighter, better visuals and generally a good upgrade over the first Quest.  I added the $49 optional headband and find it more comfortable.  If you share the Quest 2 with anyone you'll really appreciate how easy it is to adjust.  The audio isn't quite as loud as I'd like--and I'm an old geezer--so you might consider some earbuds.  Experiment with your old iPhone earbuds; they work fine.If you're new to VR. . .ignore the bad reviews from the avid gamers and get one anyway.  Remember the technology is new.  Seems to me this about like TV in the 1940s: amazing technological advancement, but not much to watch.  Even so, sometimes it's amazing how your brain will react to the illusion that you are somewhere other than your living room floor.  I really had to work to ""step off"" a ledge in Machu Pichu or in an adventure game.  Some of the VR360 videos you'll find on YouTube give an incredible sense of immersion, sometimes a little creepy but a taste of what movies will become in a few decades.  Or months!As for the privacy issues people mention, well, privacy is probably just an illusion in our modern world, anyway.  But as soon as you get online you can go to Settings and turn off a few things.  Don't let it stop you from buying this.  The taste of what's to come in video is worth it alone, and traveling during the lockdown--I like the Wander app--is a great break from just staying home. . .while you just stay home."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The best entry level VR system (and maybe the best overall),"This system is one of the best VR headsets on the market, and at the best price.The controllers track very well, and the controller batteries last a ridiculously long time.As a standalone headset, it is a pretty great system, though the library of games is a little limited and the battery of the headset only lasts 2 to 3 hours.As a PCVR headset, it has some of the best clarity (resolution) available, comparable to units that cost double it's price or more. The Link cable setup is easy, and works well. The option to play wireless with Virtual Desktop though is what really stands out.You will probably be wanting to upgrade the headstrap, headphones and get a powerbank to make the battery last longer, but even with those purchases, this headset is a good value product.You do need a Facebook account to use this. A Facebook account requires that you are at least 13 years of age, so that is something to consider if you are buying this for anyone younger than 13, or who you don't want to allow on Facebook.I also have a Rift S and have owned Playstation VR in the past. This is honestly a better product than either of them were, my Rift S is in a box in the closet now, and I sold the Playstation 4 pro and PSVR systems I had, because they were collecting dust."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,SO much fun!,"I've only ever dipped my toe into the world of VR via my iPhone and a goggle attachment. Ads for the new Oculus kept coming up on Facebook and once I saw that there were highly-rated fitness games and the low cost, I thought I'd give it a try. Well, the first night I tried it, I played until the battery ran out. The next day I started racking up all the installs on games and add-ons. Plus, with a $20 attachment to my spin bike, I can add that into the mix. For me, this is a crazy crazy life-changer! It's light so there's no pulling on your head and although I wear reading glasses, I don't seem to need them. Now I'm trying to convince my friends to get one so we can hang out in VR and stay covid safe!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Loving it!,"Before this, I've had a few different cellphone VR Sets, my son has the Playstation VR and I've also had the chance to try the Vive VR a few of times at a local media center. All of them left me with a so-so feeling afterwards. I could see the potential, but I didn't think they were quite there yet. I then saw a review for Half-Life: Alyx and discovered that I could hook the Quest 2 up to my PC and use it like an Oculus Rift! I took the plunge and haven't looked back!!! Alyx is amazing, but I also love Google Earth, Blade and Sorcery, Wander (when not hooked up to the PC), and YouTube, for its 180 and 360 degree videos! Watching 3D, 360 degree videos of other places in the world is incredible! I've only had it for just over a month and I've already gone through two sets of batteries in the controllers! My youngest son is also hooked! He's the one with the Playstation VR, but he has a few friends who have the Oculus Quest 2 and they hang out together, either chatting, or playing games together. We are having a blast and I can't recommend this enough!!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awesome experience.,"This is our family's first VR and we're loving it. Easy to set up and use. Fairly comfortable to wear for the adults, a little less so for the kids. We've tried a wide variety of content - entertainment, travel and education experiences, games of all sorts incl FPS games, art/drawing, puzzle games and the ubiquitous Beat Saber - all are awesome. Totally immersive experience.We got two 64gb headsets and they're fine for now, but I have a feeling that with the next leap in graphics and resolution we'll want additional memory, because the games will likely get bigger in size. All the purchases are cloud saved. So if I get to the point where we've got memory issues, for games where we don't need or want to save progress we can remove them from the headset and re-download when we want to play.You can buy and download games while wearing the headset or through the Occulus app on a phone or tablet. The games are actually pretty reasonably priced; most are between $10 and $30. There actually are some good action games that are free, too. Some have in-app purchases, some have additional dlc that expand the experience. It's all fairly easy to navigate from the Occulus app on my phone.The only downside is the account set-up: you have to link these suckers to a FaceBook account. When I bought them, you could link more than 1 headset to a single account, which is what I did for ours. The headsets can then share games and each headset seems to keep its own profile for progress within that game. Since both headsets are linked to the same account though, most of the games won't let us play multiplayer between the two headsets. We've found a few that do allow that, and I think more are coming. For the most part it's not an issue for us bc we often want to play different games. If multiplayer between headsets is a must-have for you, at this point you'll need each headset linked to a separate FB account - and you'll need to buy each game twice, for each account. Again, I hear FB may be adjusting the account set-up options to allow more flexibility here, so make sure you do your research in the current ""rules"" b4 buying.We also could not set up a family account with different user profiles. I hear through Reddit that is also changing soon.In short, it's an awesome experience and I think it's only going to get better. Highly recommend overall."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Fantastic buy,"Honestly I love this system. I've had it for a couple days now and it works like a dream. I would say that it is indeed a great system to introduce you to VR and has a wide array of impressive pros to relatively few cons. Yes you do need to have a facebook account but honestly there is no such thing as online privacy so you'd probably be best to stop thinking anything you do isn't being tracked or recorded somewhere. The tracking for the headset and handset is superb, probably the best I've ever seen for a non sensor box VR. I'd say you could only really notice it if you have a sensor box VR system, other than that it's pretty spot on. Won't track in dark areas which isn't that big an issue but still you should be aware. I do wish there was a more granular eye spacing set up as the 3 do indeed cover most people but sometimes just the very edge is blurry and it gets to wear on your eyes after a bit. Some of the apps I wish had an easier way to position yourself but that's not the headset's fault it's more the fault of the app. Batteries in the handsets last a super long time. I can't complain much about the headset battery life either because, honestly, it's pretty good for the clarity and speed it's playing the games at. You get about a couple hours per charge but you can plug it in to a wall socket and play indefinitely with a long enough USB-C cable. Though, I would caution about extended play sessions if you don't have the exact right focal setup because it can start to hurt your eyes, 2 hours is about the max I've been able to stand myself. Honestly I (who own every game system since the NES) consider this to be one of the most fun and best system purchases I've made since the N64. I love the multiple environments and the general flexibility of this machine, being able to play steam games super nice with an attached cable, and having other games that load right onto the headset. I love it. I honestly recommend, if you don't have a VR setup and are looking for one that works great but isn't super expensive or confusing, just get this one. If they come up with any really stupid requirements or gotcha's then I'll update this review but so far I'm loving this headset and so is the rest of my family."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Great headset, decent privacy options","I was concerned about the privacy issues associated with Facebook prior to buying this headset. I took a look at the EULA and what I'd have to do to activate the headset and I've been decently satisfied with it. While you do need a Facebook account, it is only used to login to your Oculus upon first activation. You don't have to use Facebook, ever, and it never asks you to login again.There's also options to keep your username, activity, and friends private. They have you configure this right at the start as well - no having to go into settings and search for it after. They don't record your data and everything on the Oculus side can be set to private.As for the headset itself, it's a little uncomfortable with the default strap. I'd highly recommend getting either the elite strap or a counterweight to offset the heaviness of the HMD. The overall experience itself is excellent. The image is clear and the tracking is excellent. The headset is sturdy and well made, and it looks like a lot of thought went into the consumer experience.Unless you are vehemently anti-social media I would definitely recommend a buy here. Other high-quality alternatives are the Valve Index (which is not as simple as the quest so take note). The first time you experience high-quality VR, it's really a game-changer in the literal sense of the word."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing and so much fun!,"My first virtual reality system! I am very amazed and it is so much fun for me and the whole family. The world of VR and being fully immersed in an outter worldly environment is like nothing I have experienced before. My Xbox and PC have been collecting dust as of late. There is alot of entertainment and games to pick from. A decent amount of free titles/demos to try before you start spending. There are games/apps on sale every week or few days which is nice. You can also connect this to your PC if your gfx card is supported to run even better games. And as for the Facebook thing I don't have a problem. I have had a facebook since it came out. I don't post rude or ignorant stuff and just keep to my close friends and family so I won't have a problem. The ones griefing about being banned are obviously not telling you the full story of why they got banned. Just follow the rules and you will be fine. You can also change alot of the privacy settings through Facebook too if need be, so don't feel it's all that intrusive. I don't see the big deal. Don't let the Facebook thing scare you away as it had almost to me."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A real Review,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   This is an amazing piece of technology. Very emersive.  Battery life for the console is not bad at all gives about and hour to and hour and a half of continuous play. Can squeeze more out of it depending on the type of game your playing. Standby time is long have had mines stay alive for days on standby time. Volume is low unless you have headphones in. When using headphones its beautiful surround sound. I haven't experienced any fogging.  Only downfall for me(not the system) is I get super nauseas when playing some games. To the point where I have to take an anti nausea pill to continue playing. Video quality is definitely HD. All in all an amazing system. Also haven't had any connection issues. I do recommend using a high speed connection."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Oculus Quest 2 = affordable, very epic headset","Motion Tracking = amazingcontrollers = durable (i accidentally dropped mine multiple times onto concrete)headset = small, comfortable, and durable with around 3 hours of battery life (your eyes don't need anymore than that and you can also charge it while playing if you have the right extension cords)You can adjust the eyesight to fit people with glasses and it worked for everyone in my house.There are a variety of games and a test game so you know what you're doing, I bough superhot, job simulator, and Walking Dead: Saints and SinnersI highly recommend buying Superhot and Job simulator first, as they are simple games and good introductions. My family loved playing job simulator as well.The games are super cool, I love Walking Dead VR, its just too much fun. If you want you can connect this to a pc (as long as it can handle good games) and then play some games that AREN'T on the oculus quest 2 yet and are on steam.Just so you know, you need a Facebook account to sign up. You do not need a phone to play, just to set it up. If you're worried about privacy, or getting banned and losing all your games, then create a fake account like me. I created just some random account and stored my stuff on there. No privacy problems.15/10"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,LOVE IT !!,"There is very little I can say here that hasn't already been said, except I LOVE THIS VR HEADSET !!  I've owned several VR headsets before, and this is the best one on the market, and fortunately it's very reasonably priced too.  If you haven't yet discovered VR, buy this immediately!  It's perfect, not only for hardcore virtual reality enthusiasts or gamers, but also the beginner.  It's very intuitive to operate, to learn and understand.  No PC needed.  No wires.  No external cameras you have to mount all over the walls.  Just take it out of the box and start having fun.  You can play amazingly immersive games, watch 3D movies, or 3D 180 degree or 360 degree videos, adult content, family friendly content, amazing creativity and artistic apps, educational experiences, relaxation and meditation experiences, attend concerts, go to virtual movies with other people and interact socially with others in many ways.  You can use the controllers, or in many cases use your hands (it tracks the position of your hands wonderfully).  You can even connect it wirelessly to your computer and have a virtual keyboard in VR that matches your own keyboard, and type on it.  Amazing.  The list of what you can do with the Oculus Quest 2 is huge, and growing fast.  Don't be left out of all the fun.  BUY THIS NOW."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A Good Investment!,"I am glad I waited for the All-in-one version of Oculus. I installed an app on my phone, linked it to my Facebook profile, and was able to start purchasing and playing apps / games immediately.It is an immersive experience! Make sure your surroundings are safe for game play. It is easy to lose balance in 360 mode or in apps that have zero gravity levels -- like the free NASA ISS app, I about fell over three times in less than 5 minutes on the space station. lolThis is a more worthwhile investment than a console if you're looking for new experiences, want a good work out, and want the option to socialize too. It is great during the pandemic, especially since we're heading into Pandemic 2.0 with newer strains of the virus.You'll want adequate space for room scale play, at least 6.5 ft x 6.5 ft. Stationary play you can do in probably a 3 x 3 ft space, standing or sitting. I recommend a sweat guard for the headset and grips for the controllers if you plan on playing hard / exercising with it.Have fun and be patient! VR is still in it's infancy and we have a lot to look forward to in the next few years!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best Mother's Day Gift Ever!,"Ok, so I'm not tech savvy, nor am a great graphic art critique, so I'm not going to review this based on its technical superiority or how great the developers have done with it. It is super immersive, comfortable, and utterly amazing. My review is from the POV of a 53 year old woman who wanted one of these to get off my butt and get moving. And from that perspective, this thing is an absolute rock star! I now ""work out"" for no less than an hour every night - not because I'm trying to get my cardio time in or because I'm trying to burn off calories (I have a treadmill if I really want to torture myself), but because I'm having F U N !!! The kinetic games for OQ2 that I've tried so far are challenging and fun and I haven't gotten bored yet. It's so satisfying to get finished playing dripping in sweat with my heart rate in the 130s (not super high I know, but it works for me). If you're looking for something that will get you up and moving AND won't feel like a chore, you should give this a shot."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"A few issues, in my opinion","(Updated to 5 stars: Now I have Eleven Table Tennis, Holopoint, and Thrill of the Fight, and these three games are all I need to stay fit.)Unlike a lot of other reviews here, I'm actually OK with being required to register with a Facebook account.I bought this headset mainly to stay active, and my main interest is the ping-pong games, especially Eleven Table Tennis. I will also use it to watch some movies and/or Youtube.My irritations are minor.  (1) Battery life is not very good.  Within just 2-3 hours, you're looking at a dead battery.  (2) Games so far, at the end of 2020, are not all that good unless you are into first-person shooting games.  Yes, the graphics are pretty, but the integration with the controllers isn't very good.  (For example, for fast motions slightly behind the head, as in table tennis games, the headset can't pick up the movement very well.)  (3) The controllers also eat up AA batteries, so rechargeable batteries are recommended.If you run into an issue where the screen goes black and very little happens when you hit the power button, aside from the advice online, try tightening down the forehead piece and/or moving your hair out of the way of the interior sensor.  When I moved the hair covering my forehead out of the way, the sensor detected me.As an introduction to VR, it's very good, at a very reasonable price.  I just wish the battery life was longer."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,What? You don’t own one yet? Why not?,"This could be the best product I ever purchased. I am amazed how much Oculus squeezed into one device. It is a self contained gaming system, video and movie viewer, exercise machine, meditation coach, should I go on? The only “negative” is you need to set it up with a Facebook account, but after that you never need to go on the Facebook app. So what they track your every move, who doesn’t these days?  For $299 I dare you to find a better way to spend your hard earned cash. One caveat, buy the Halo strap ( on Amazon) and throw away the cheap head strap that comes with the unit. Other than that you need nothing else.  Check out the TRIPP app for all your meditation needs."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,MIND-BLOWING!!!,"Virtual Reality is an experience that you do NOT want to miss out on. The Oculus Quest 2 offers one of the highest resolution and high-end Virtual Reality experiences at a very affordable price. It can be used as a stand-alone system to play Oculus exclusive titles, and also offers PC connectivity with the optional Link cable or Virtual Desktop. Air Link is coming pretty soon as well, and that will probably make Virtual Desktop obsolete. You can play all of your SteamVR applications, provided that your PC can run them. The games are powered directly by your PC, and your headset is just a display.I personally don’t have an issue with linking my Facebook account to the headset. Oculus is owned by Facebook, so it makes sense. Almost everything requires that you have an account of some kind anyways. If you’re concerned about Facebook collecting your info, then I have news for you -- so does EVERYTHING else! Your mobile phone tracks the apps you use and the websites you visit in order to deliver ads that are more personalized and relevant to you. Your internet service provider has records of your browsing history -- even what you thought was “private.” YouTube uses your watch history to give you more relevant video recommendations and advertisements. Google tracks your search history to give you more relevant search results and ADS! The list goes on and on. Privacy is the ultimate price of technology. It always has been and always will be. As long as you’re not doing anything illegal, you have nothing to fear.I cannot recommend this headset enough, especially at its current price point. I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY the first time I put it on and launched a VR application. It really does feel like you’re there. Sometimes your brain will play tricks on you and you’ll do something you know you can’t really do. This is why it’s important to draw out a safe play area. Some experiences can be disorienting, nauseating, or even terrifying -- such as cruising through the skies on a jetpack, riding a rollercoaster, or walking through a haunted house. It is a WHOLE OTHER WORLD that you are experiencing in VR, and it is simply amazing. You do not want to miss it. If you’re on the fence, add this thing to your cart right now. You won’t regret it!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Impressive intro to VR with ability to play PC games as well,"I bought this on a whim to play around with VR.  I'm very impressed with what Occulus has built for only $300. The wireless and no PC required experience is really quite good given you're basically running on cell phone level components.  I've only played a couple games but have already gotten my money worth in enjoyment just from those games.  I encourage owners to try Echo VR (free) and Population One (not free).  Additionally you can use a link cable and get some games for your PC (recommend Half-Live Alyx).  The controllers track really well, I have no complaints about the controllers and battery lift off of just AA batteries is really remarkable.  The goggles can be a bit blurry to me and I can sometimes hear the fan or gyro noise coming from them while playing but it doesn't distract from the experience.  I find the headset comfortable with the included strap, perhaps I will try some 3rd party upgrades down the road but right now I don't see the need.  VR has come a long way in a few years and at this price point it's worth playing around with even if you just end up playing a few games with it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Objectively worth it,"Within a week of owning my first Quest 2 I had dealt with some software issue leading to it being completely unable to complete setup (even using Oculus' troubleshooting and other suggested methods to make it work) so I initially had very low hopes of enjoying the overall experience. Got a replacement from Amazon on the 25th, managed to get through setup easily, and onto PCVR easily (needing a cable you acquire separately).Now we move to the point in time in which I have had the headset for ~2 weeks, and have been using it nearly every day, for however long. Immediately not having to worry about setting up base stations to track the headset/controllers is very appealing, and aside from some slight issues with controller tracking (such as if you move them too far behind you) its been a great experience, and has been very easy to move to a larger or smaller playspace as a game needs (within the range of my cable/where I can move my PC).If you're okay with the fact that Facebook is effectively able to just brick your headset (as it still requires a FB account if you dont want to risk bricking it trying to work around the issue) than it's still one of the easiest, cheapest ways to try VR unless you're willing to buy a used Rift S on ebay (which will ofcourse require a PC in order to use at all)Overall opinion thus far; 8/10, Buy a better head strap while you're at it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great way to get into VR,"I love the Quest 2!  I've always wanted to get into VR, but it was always too complicated and expensive.  Finally the Quest 2 made it simple and relatively inexpensive.  No cables or sensors.  It's all in the headset.  And it just works. I have been playing it for a month now for at least a couple of hours a day, and everything has been great. The experiences you can have are like nothing else.  It can feel so real and immersive.  I love letting other people try and getting to see their reactions.  It's awesome!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.There are only a couple of negatives I've run into.  One, there a not a ton of games available.  There are plenty to keep you busy for a quite a while and there are new ones coming out.  But there is not a lot of variety.  And I wish bigger games would make VR versions.  Still worth it though.  Two, the battery life is not incredibly long.  It usually lasts a little over 2 hours, but sometimes I want to play longer.  This can be remedied by getting the elite strap with battery or a third party battery like I did.  Three, the price of accessories.  I couldn't bring myself to pay for the elite strap with battery, even though I wanted it.  I did end up buying the elite strap by itself, because the strap that comes with it can get uncomfortable.  Unfortunately it broke within a week and it took 3 weeks to get a replacement.  That's ridiculous for something that costs as much as it does.  It is more comfortable though.All in all I still think it is an amazing product and well worth the price."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,OMG!!,"So I'm not the most tech savvy so it took me sometime to setup but it was super easy. I couldn't wait until the next morning to play it for the first time. I got this product so I could workout and have fun because I hate gyms and being in the sun. lol I was super tired after only doing 10 minutes but I hoped right back on. lol I did notice that even though I turned off the headset overnight. the next day I had a low battery so now I see I will need to charge more frequently than I thought. I'm still getting use to how the controllers work. In the middle of working out if I push the trigger by accident it will ask me if I was to resume, quit or restart.  LONG STORY SHORT!! I'm super happy with my purchase. It is relaxing too. I meditate just sitting on the floor listening to the music."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Don't listen to the trolls. Quest 2 is incredible!!!,"First of all for all the morons that think you're interesting enough for Facebook to collect your info and it .atters at all. Go live off of the grid and quit being hypocritical. You're vegans wearing leather shoes trying to stop pollution while driving a beat up vw that wouldn't pass an emission test. The Quest 2 is frigging awesome!!! I have been buying vr headsets since the beginning. The graphics still have a long way to go. Alyx from steam is the best yet. The headset can't quite keep up with what Valve has created. It's borderline real, but it gets laggy at times. I put a tower fan to cool my play area which has helped a lot. A spring loaded retractable cord for the pc connection would be ideal though. I pinned mine to the ceiling and have it dangle in the middle of my play area but still gets in the way. This is an evolutionary step and not the finished product people. Name one thing that is perfect? Quit being such winey little bitchs. Trolls just need a hug and a beat down. If you're looking for an out of body experience...quest 2."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing!!!! Awesome!!!! Fun for the whole family!!!,"Best 👏 game 👏 ever 👏Seriously this is the coolest thing I have ever played on! The graphics are superb! I bought two for my kids to share and ended up buying two more because we got tired of sharing! I am 42 years old, not a gamer at all, and play just as much as they do. It has been so much fun bonding with them and playing Beat saber and other games. Battery lasts a few hrs, charges quick, updates are quick. Highly recommend!!! Oh, and games are fairly inexpensive, much more affordable compared to Xbox and Wii. Promo codes and deals to save even more and if you end up not liking a game, you can get a refund!I think the ONLY negative point I have to say is that I wish it were easier to cast to a TV so other people can see what you are doing. This might be a learning issue, as I am still trying to figure things out. I did discover the recording feature but haven't used it yet.Is it worth $399? In my opinion, it absolutely is worth it!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Made our quarantine fun,"I have been using the Oculus Quest 2 for the last 2 weeks during our quarantine (10 year old son tested positive for COVID, but thankfully was asymptomatic). We were losing our minds and felt like we had watched every movie and played every video and board game we could. To save our sanity I bought the Quest 2 thinking that the price was low enough that if we didn't like, not a big loss. However, I've got to say that the technology is fantastic! Easy to use and the games are a lot of fun. It really feels like you are transported to another world for a brief time, which has been very welcome during this challenging year. Unlike other video games, I find the VR games to be more ""experiences"". It can be very stimulating, so I make sure our kids just play the games for no more than 20 minutes at a time. On the other hand, some the experiences can be very relaxing. Playing VR Walkabout Minigolf for a few holes really helps me to settle down at the end of the day. Other outstanding games have included: Moss, The Room, Beat Saber, Vader Immortal, and Tetris Effect.If you are thinking about buying one, especially if you are stuck at home due to COVID restrictions, just do it. You won't regret it. Truly unique experiences that you can have from the comfort of your own home. I hate Facebook, and never use my account for social purposes. However, using a Facebook account solely for VR has not lead to any intrusions into my digital life."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,One Fantastic VR Headset!,"I have been playing VR games for years. I gotta say, I love my Vive with Index controllers. I even love the original Vive wands. But this... this thing here, this is awesome! Great price, great games, great fun, NO WIRES! GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE NOW! Everyone needs one ;) Join the revolution in gaming! I new console has emerged, and it gives you more freedom than you've ever had anyone in this world of ours. Even the freedom to travel to other worlds, some near and dear to hearts, others new and waiting to be explored. It's a powerful device and a small package. There are a few games that don't look as good as the PC version but all you gotta do is plug it into your PC via a cable (sold separately) and BAM, your playin PC VR games :) This is the VR headset to buy if your unsure about VR but your really interested. GET THIS SYSTEM! It's so fun! If you can afford the games ;)"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The Future is NOW! WOOOOOO!,"This product is amazing; I no longer have to leave my house to go on adventures. There's no wasting time driving to and from places, no fees per entrance, it's just strap-in an go. The lens needs some getting used to, and finding that optical sweet spot at first can be a little tricky, but once it's found it's just smooth sailing. The future of VR technology thanks to this innovative company is looking great.There's currently some controversy with the required Facebook account though; personally I think the worry about the privacy is a little over-hyped, but I also understand the concern. If I put myself in Facebook's shoes, I'd actually do the same thing to prevent users from sharing a game en masse like Netflix being shared, which is a problem for streaming services in general. I mean, after all, Facebook has already established preventative measures for fake accounts and VR is still in it's infancy; we wouldn't want the VR industry to be killed because developers can't make money now right?"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This gaming system is a masterpiece of technology,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I've played video games my whole life, but I have never experienced anything like the Oculus Quest 2.Everything you need is in this headset and controlled via two hand controllers.The games are so realistic that once you put the headset on, you forget where you are.Here's my son playing a virtual reality boxing game called ""The Thrill of the fight.""Overall, this gaming system is a masterpiece of technology.  It will require you to login with a Facebook account, and the system does not include any games.  Games are purchased virtually and range in pricing.  Some games can cause a bit of dizziness while playing, and others can give you an ultimate workout.  This is worth every penny for the experience you get when using, and I highly recommend it.  Therefore I rate this product five out of five stars."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This review is going to be pros and then cons.,Pros: this is a big advancement from the previous quest. The display is amazing and the tracking is just a tad better than the previous quest. The price is great for what you get. Battery life is decent but the controller battery life is best of any. Everything functions well and the side loading is just as easy as ever. Cons: the head strap that's the biggest thing. The head strap will rub and start to hurt especially around the ear. Also if you have long or thick hair it likes to grab and pull a bit. The elite strap easily replaces this but then that's another expense but we'll worth it. The other con is the face pad. I have sensitive skin and the face pad made a red ring around my face after the first hour and I had a massive breakout that stayed for about a week. To prevent this I took an extra leather face pad from my quest 1 and ripped the foam off the quest 2 and used a soft flexible stretchy glue to adhere the leather pad directly on the bracket for the quest 2
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Most Well-Rounded VR on market!!,"Quest 2 is definitely worth the money!Pros:-It's a standalone system, no computer needed and only an internet connection to download games or play multiplayer. Travels well!-It also works great as a PCVR headset if you have a good computer. Added bonus with Air Link let's you play PCVR wirelessly without needing to buy pricey Bluetooth adapters like with the Vive.-Great display with crisp images-Tons of fun and honestly could go on and on about it.Cons:-The battery life is only about 4 hours if your gaming. But a power pack helps-The 3 preset settings for pupil distance sometimes makes that perfect setting hard for some people. But it's not a deal breaker.Even if this thing cost more, it would still be a great buy, the fact that it's so cheap makes it hard to pass up especially considering how versatile and powerful it is. You could spend more and probably have better PCVR gaming experience. But if you had this and an Index or Vive, I guarantee you'd come back to the Quest 2 more often then the more expensive set."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A New Reality,"Bought this for my grandkids and it has been the hit for the holidays. Everyone plays it.  Grandkids, kids, parents, grandparents.  The device provides access to a number of games that puts the players at the center of a virtual reality experience. As an Combat Vet, I decided to try the game Onward.  WOAH, what an amazing experience.  The game placed me in a cartoon virtual world full of enemy combatants, and provided a number of options for me to engage the “enemy” to survive.  This system can be a lot of fun.  Some people may have a hard time getting accustomed to the VR experience, especially if they are prone to motion sickness. This device and games, however, are well worth the money."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best purchase of 2020,"As a 43 year old man with a family who has been a gamer most of his life, coming from Atari 2600 to PS4, this is a total game changer. Games won't have the visual quality of powerful modern consoles but the mechanics, and smoothness of movement plus the sound effects on each ear, plus the immersive experience makes this ""console"" my best purchase in the last years.I don't feel like I'm outside a fun game anymore, I'm INside the game playing it and the attention to detail is awesome. The exercise and physical activity factor is huge here, just think, you're playing videogames and you're exercising. What else?"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Endless Possibilities,"Excellent product.Cons:HEAVY!!! Can get very hot on your face. Blurry even with the eye adjustments. Glasses extender does not work (a friend of mine tried it out and it didn't allow enough clearance). High price point. Some games can cause motion sickness.Pros:Literally everything else. Extremely easy set up. Great interface. Wireless. Decent picture quality. Great speakers. Sleek design. Lightweight hand controllers with excellent design. Easy to adjust strap. Link cable (not included) allows you to have the same experiences through steam as the rift model, and with the help of a really long hdmi the whole family can feel as if they are mining with you! When wearing the vr you are no longer in a living room. It is extremely immersive and addictive. I have high hopes for the future generations of this vr line."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The best VR experience money can buy! (with a catch),"This headset is a wonder of modern technology! It is a VR headset that can be played by anyone from a child to an elder, and its simple, intuitive controls, its fun, realistic gameplay, and its fast, sharp graphics make it the Wii of VR technology; that is to say, if VR becomes mainstream, it will be down to the genius of this device. The screen resolution is so unbelievably high that you WILL NOT experience screen-door effect AT ALL. For those who get dizzy playing VR, fear not! This product has the treatment for that affliction as well with its 90Hz(!) refresh rate.The selection of games which can be played standalone is slightly limited - the Oculus store is very selective about its titles, but you will still be able to play audience favourites such as Beat Saber, Super Hot, Vader Immortal, Pistol Whip, Reel VR, and games like them. Furthermore, with Oculus Link (which costs extra for the cable), you can ply PC VR games, negating the limited selection of titles and allowing you to play any game your PC can run.What's the catch? Facebook has you by the balls if you own this headset. Your facebook account gets suspended? You have a $300 paperweight. Why is this device so cheap? How can they afford to sell it? They sell it at a loss in the hopes that your game sales and personal data will be valuable enough to make it worth their while. And don't even think about customising your $300 product which you own and purchased with your own money - in some cases it may actually be illegal! You can do what facebook wants you to be able to do, and not much else.This is the best VR product on the market. Fans of VR will love it. Newcomers will love it. Coders, developers, and people who care about privacy and freedom...might have a bone to pick."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just buy it,"This is the most fun you can have at home.  You will find your virtual world can be better than your real world.  I use it for workouts (supernatural workout is amazing), and for travelling to places that i may never see in real life (like a 3d 360 degree tour of Notre Dam being reconstructed).  Expect to pay $10-30 per game, while some are free, and most tours are free.  I've had it for a month, purchased the smaller memory, and am fine with that size memory.  You will love it and want to share it with people, because it's so amazing."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The Oculus Quest 2 is amazing and here’s why!,I bought the Oculus Quest 2 since I felt like the Quest 1 was starting to get a little outdated and didn’t want to stick around with the one when it would become completely outdated and I have to say the quest 2 is a very good upgrade from the one. For one it’s cheaper than the quest 1 and has a very good picture quality as well as a much better gameplay experience. If you do have the quest 1 and don’t have the money for the 2 right away I wouldn’t say it’s a necessity at the moment but sometime in the future as with all video game consoles eventually you probably will have to upgrade since it will become outdated sometime in the future. Overall though I love the quest 2 my only complaint about it though is the strap it comes with but you can buy a very cheap but a major upgraded head strap on Amazon as well!
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,great fun,I am not a gamer but I have had a great time with this VR set .  there are lots of fun things you can do and the VR just blows me away most of the time.  The sound is fantastic and the quality of the display is amazing .  For what you get the price is fair I think I would recommend getting the more expensive one with the larger memory you will fill up the 64G one quickly if you play games.  I find most of the games a bit expensive but I don't have a good feel for what they cost on other platforms.  they seem to be from free to $40  there are a lot of lower priced ones around $10  which is not bad.  I would like to try some of them but spending $40 for a game that I probably will not be able to play or maybe even like is hard to justify.  You can return some games within 7 days so that is a nice feature.  I think it was worth the money and I enjoy the puzzle type games a lot.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Value,Let me just say this don't buy something without doing research...  If it's blurry contact oculus themselves they'll send a replacement headset.  As for price wise...  People I've seen on the reviews have done nothing but complain about the price.  #1 yes it cheaply made on the outside that's why the price is $300#2 it rubs on the new graphics cards which is extremely expensive to begin with.#3 it is a really good product by far superior to oculus quest 1 and keeps getting new good updates to make it look even more amazing. This headset is worth $450-$500 all the people saying it does not absolutely know nothing on how much that hardware is.  Hands down the best headset I've ever used
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A VR worth your Identity,"This thing is amazing. I had the PS4 VR and stopped playing it a long time ago because of all the wires and set up.Not the Occulus Quest 2! I play almost every day. Zero wires (except to charge). No external cameras or sensors to set up. Just turn on, draw your play boundary, and get playing. I feel like I'm living in the future.Thank you Facebook for making this affordable (financially that is...of course they have my identity and soul I think, but I don't have a line for that in my budget so I'm good)!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This is it.,"Yes it requires a facebook login and it is intrusive. Yes it is not as powerful as the top of the line vr that requires a high end pc. Yes the strap is a little janky.None of that matters because words cannot describe how incredible it is. The experience it delivers is everything that we have been promised that vr would be since the 90s. If you have been waiting to get into VR, this is the time."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Lot’s of fun!,"I had always been interested in virtual reality (VR) but the prices on the headsets and the fact that they almost always had to be connected to a PC or a game station put it beyond the realm of what I wanted to pay. This headset is very reasonable, has a lot of apps for reasonable prices, is easy to use, and an incredible amount of fun.One of the wonderful features is that it has what it calls “guardian”. It is a virtual barrier you can set  that pops up a grid in front of you, if during your play you come near an object like a wall or the sofa. It is easy VR to get to energetic and drift toward the edge of a play area. The guardian has saved me more than once from running into the wall.So, I recommend this as a reasonably priced and nicely featured VR headset."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing little headset with only two very small downsides,"Amazing device, blew my mind with its graphics. This happens to be my intro to VR. I would recommend for anyone. I get motion sickness from games where you actually have to move around without moving around so watch out for that. Games on oculus are much more affordable than your standard console games while being more fun in my opinion. I highly recommend Job simulator as a first game. My 2 only gripes are the speakers and hand tracking. the console tracks controllers like a charm, both sitting and standing, but hand tracking only fully works while standing and even then is prone to many bugs if you move too fast. En masse, I highly, HIGHLY, recommend this device to anyone with even a sliver of interest in trying VR."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing,"Very nice device. I've tried others and this is in a perfect niche. I use mine plugged into my pc to play steam vr titles, but if you've got something installed on the quest itself, you can take it on the go.No screen door effect at all. Surprisingly good speakers and mic. Great hand tracking. I only wish the battery would last a little longer.If you're playing games thru your pc, you won't be able to get enough power through the usb cable to actually charge it; just enough to slow it down.Unplugged battery lasts about 2 1/2 hours, but plugged in it's much longer. Hours and hours. Note that you will never get it to charge up while you are using it. You're not supposed to do that, but whatever... Just don't think that you need to buy new chargers and cables and all this stuff; the quest does not let itself get charged except for short  bursts. It's for safety and heat considerations.Anyway buy this thing it's great"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Better quest,It really is better than the first oculus quest. It does have better performance and better pixle rate. It also is smaller.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best whole-family Christmas gift ever!  This Mama is loving it.,"I bought this for my kids and did not expect to enjoy it as much as I have.  I find myself impatiently waiting for them to get done playing & take a break so I can have a turn!  As a longtime migraine sufferer, I thought there was a good chance that it would trigger headaches or dizziness for me, but to my surprise, I find it quite comfortable & fun to use and it hasn't bothered me a bit.  It was very easy to set up and start using and it feels balanced, secure, and comfortable on my head.  I also like how easy it was to set up the play area so you don't bump into things - I didn't realize it had cameras on the outside so you can actually see the room when you're setting it up.  This technology is so amazing.  Very happy to have splurged on it - I know it's going to make this cold COVID shut-in winter so much more fun."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Most fantastic fun,I have tried the first Oculus Quest VR at a friends house and ever since then I wanted this!  I put it off for awhile and glad I did because now I have this and its another world.  I love it. I'm getting more exercise and I love the art and crafting games and I cant wait to shoot zombies. I also love the exploring games where I can travel the world while still being in my living room. I hesitated though for a week or so because I did not like that it would be attached to Facebook but I got over it.  I love it.  Its so much fun!!  I cant wait to try more games.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This thing is amazing,"Wow Wow Wow! I am so impressed with this. I had an Oculus Go for a while, and although the Go was great, this is absolutely amazing.Out of the box I charged it and logged in very easily with my Oculus App via Facebook. Fortunately I also ordered a third party elite strap from Amazon ahead of time. I tried the strap that came with the Quest 2 and it was awful. No big surprise, and I was ready for that. I don’t mind having to get a better strap because it’s probably keeping the price of the unit down a bit by shipping it with a cheap one.The controllers are comfortable and pretty easy to use. It does get a bit confusing at first but you quickly get used to it.I’m not going to bore you with stating what everyone else is saying. But I can say it’s an amazing unit and I will be spending many hours using it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oculus Quest 2 is so fun I had 2 friends buy one within 5 minutes of playing.,"Bought the Oculus Quest 2 after playing it over a friends house and it was amazing the first day I bought it. A friend of mine was over the night it arrived and after playing it for 3 minutes he bought one himself.A week later another one of my friends came by, played it and purchased right after they got off the game. Since I purchased it I played it every day except two.Hella tiring, in a good way. I love it so far.I love the fact that it allows you to draw your boundary on the floor so you can play in just about any size room.The downside, the battery life is about 2 hours. Other than that it's a hell of a lot of funI've purchased 3 apps so far - Super Hot (A Mission Impossible training game); Racket: NX (A 360 Degree Racquetball experience); FitXR (A Fitness app, I've done boxing so far). I've played Beat Saber (Demo) and Sports Scramble. All amazingly fun apps/workouts"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Gear is good, but the games are expensive","This VR set is a bargain. The only thing I dislike about the machine is the Oculus software on it. It requires you to purchase the games and only has short demos. The free games are rarely good. The quality of the headset and controllers are great. I use this for exercising, but when I finally found a game that was good, I could only play a short demo. The full game itself was over $70. I am amazed by the prices of the games, they are mostly $15 and above. I wish that the games were free or at least cheaper."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great Entry-level VR Headset,"I got this after wanting, and trying, several of the original VR headsets. I have always been interested in VR but the price to performance was never good enough to justify buying my own. This was until I tried my buddies Quest 1. I then decided it was time. I ordered the Quest 2 256 gb model and was not disappointed. Of course the Facebook thing is absolutely awful and I hate it, but I have an account that I'm almost never on and I figured having one footprint in the social world wouldn't kill me, and, honestly, I've had no issues with it to date. Now I'll list some pros and cons after my first week of use.Pros:-Its a lot more comfortable than people make it out to be-Battery life isn't awful considering I don't use it for more than a few hours at a time (rebuff reality battery pack on the way)-The display is pretty clear but my IPD is about 60 so that's a bummer-Its very light so my neck doesn't get too worn out with extended use-I love the guardian system and passthrough feature-Controllers track really well considering the lack of lighthouse modules-The user interface is really easy to use-Its also built like a tank (already dropped it :()Cons:-The regular headstrap is okay definitely not as bad as people say though-The controller wrist straps will not keep you from throwing them-The hand tracking feature is a bit spotty and unreliable-The white shell of the headset and controllers will pick up every little scuff and scratch if you hit something-The foam interface will soak up sweat like nothing else so sharing with friends can be quite gross-The included interface also seems to pop out quite easily after pulling it out the first time so be aware of thatConclusion:I can not be happier with my purchase and the slight flaws are more than reasonable given the price. It seems you are really just paying for better hardware rather than a hefty shell. If you don't mind selling your soul to facebook, it's a great place to start!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A total immersive experience worth every penny,"A friend brought one over to show us. The experience was so (beyond) amazing, I had to buy one. I thought it would be a thousand dollars. Had no idea i could get one for 300. Of course I bought the one for 400 for the extended memory for games. I have since bought a few apps. Really inexpensive to be honest. Then of course even Amazon prime has a VR site to get things to watch.. for free. If you like music or (anything) for that matter, you'll find a vr (virtual reality) version available to load or watch on this device. It truly is a life changer. And if you are a science fiction buff, and follow the 2 most popular space series, well get ready to be involved with either the captain of the ship, or the big guy with the very deep voice. Talking to him face to face.Yes, you know exactly who Im talking about. Its truly like being in the movie."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Ridiculously fun and great quality,"I've only had my Quest 2 for two weeks and I'm already loving it. I'll try to make a shorter review without missing essential points.-The quest has very nice quality display, with barely, if any screen door effect.-You're really getting a great package here. The box alone can be used to store the quest until you get a good case-The controllers come preloaded with batteries, all you have to do is remove the contact tabs.-A nice hard copy manual and health +safety guide are includedThe major difference between the quest and PC VR is the Quest is a little more limited in hardware specs.With that said, it's a big step up from the original, and there's some amazing games on this thing that will keep you going for hours.I can't say enough good about the crazy amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of the games on Quest so far. There's practically something for everybody.Can't say enough good about the crazy amount of enjoyment I've"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,My favorite purchase of the year,"I'm loving my Oculus! I'm 49, female and don't really play video games other than Mario Kart with a kid.  But I do love good music and being active so Beat Saber is by far my favorite game.  I keep the glasses extender in all the time, even with contacts in. It seems to make my vision better. I have the upgraded head band, which is highly recommended.  Just wish it had a built in fan because my face is a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I find it a little too heavy while playing mini golf, having to look down a lot.  Oh! Highly recommend The Room games.  I was so sad when I finished it.  It's also fun to watch Netflix on or just sit in a virtual environment and relax.  Sound is great.  It's truly amazing technology that is for sure!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Wow... Who needs a PS5 when you can immerse yourself...,"I wanted a PS5, but got sick of trying to battle these jerks and their bots in order to buy one.  I had heard good things about the Oculus Quest 2, so I bought one of these instead...WOAH!!!  THIS THING IS AMAZING!!!!I could care less about getting a PS5 now!!  My wife and I both play it and actually fight over who gets to play it next!  The games are so much fun and watching Amazon Prime TV & video is really cool!!  It's like you're in an actual theater!  You really do almost feel like you're in the Movie ""Ready Player One.""  I think this is the stepping stone for the next generation of gaming and chatting.  I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these!  I've already hooked many friends into buying one after playing mine!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Future is here and Oculus Quest is #1 gaming system,"Best advance gaming system in the market. My review is my opinion. 30-40 years in gaming and this machine here is really the future. I don’t have nothing negative to say. Yes Is a company from facebook, but we all know this and I really congratulate them for this machine. I also could say that right now is competing in the top spot for gaming consoles hands down. And I have an Xbox Series and PS5. But this right here is a game changer. So for the price is a perfect. Games are super.  So I will give my 10/10 review to the Quest 2. Don’t hesitate. I would recommend the 256 gb if you going to download a lot games. The 64 is perfect too.  The only small thing that I would tweak if I was Facebook labs is the battery. It would last at leas 3-4 hours playing. But I think is good since you need a break."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I love it!,For anyone that has been waiting for VR to be lower price and wireless this is the time. I thought the price point was just to good to be true but its so much better than I could have imagined. The biggest selling point for me is the WIRLESS PCVR. I have played wired and wireless and its not even a competition. Not having to worry about wires is the best part of the headset. The main downside I will say is battery life. An extended power brick is almost a must have. I got the VR Power by REbuff Reality. Other than that though for the price and all the great very competitive features its the clear choice for most people. The Valve Index is just to expensive and doesn't have wireless needs a dedicated room for base stations and doesn't have games built into the headset. $1000 vs $300 and you know what im going to pick.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing VR Experience!,"This is just the perfect headset - price wise, quality wise, convenience wise.A standalone portable headset, which you don't need a PC or a smartphone to use, with only $299, high enough resolution so that no SDE, good sound and mic to really enjoy, so easy to set up, what else you need?Moreover, if you have a powerful PC, you can play all the games in SteamVR!  The Quest store alone has a lot of games/apps enough to satisfy your appetite. And you have sidequest, which has literally 10x more games/apps compared to Quest store!Watching youtube (flat) using Quest 2 is really enjoying. Watching 6DOF movie, where you can walk inside the movie, is mind blowing. Playing games using 6DOF where you can walk around, pick up stuffs using both of your hands, are crazy immersive! All of this with only $299. Go grab one now!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Better then my INDEX in many way,"Battery - I cant complain get about 2hours and 30 minutes (ish) on full, I play it connected to my High End PC so I get 4 - 5 hours with the  Party Link 16ft USB c to USB c cable.IPD - Only has 3 setting and mine is 58 so for me the first setting is great with no complaints hereFOV - not bad but coming from an INDEX i can tell the difference , if this is your First VR headset it will be great purchase .PC VR - Doing a great job doing PC VR games like Half Life Alyx, Beat Sabers and VR Chat, the real selling feature for me is being able to play PC VR using Virtual Desktop (with a SideQuest Patch) makes this a must buy over any other Headset at this time.Cons -  Terrible Head strap and wish i could order the Elite strap but it seems to sold outOVERALLIf you are Ok with using your FB account then this is a great and wonderful device for the price and you wont find anything close to what this is for the price."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Mind Blown,"I am a pretty snooty PC gamer with a high end machine and I look down from my ivory tower on all the lesser gamers.  If it can't match my system and hit 165fps on my 165hz 2k monitor, it's not good enough.  So I've avoided the whole VR market, awaiting something worthwhile.Boy was I mistaken.  Turns out I've been missing out for at least a year.  The quest 2 is pretty amazing by itself, so versatile and doesn't disappoint with the graphics.  But connect this thing to your high end gaming PC and it's a new world for you.  Best graphics I've ever encountered.  Blows regular gaming away.Highly recommend expanding your gaming to this.  And don't worry about Facebook, they already have your information.  And if they don't, Google does.  Or Apple."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Don’t listen to other reviews,"Honestly I was kinda worried cause of the whole Facebook account thing but it’s fine like if you post like 1 or 2 stories on there then it’s fine. I did have problems with it before but if you ever have problems setting your headset up then go to oculus support and they will help you that’s how I fixed my problem. The main thing most people worry about is how many games you can have on your oculus quest 2 answer is a lot, you can have 24 games total and possible increased storage in future software updates and the final bit how comfortable is wearing the headset, well it’s great if you have it adjusted at the right angle but make sure you take your time adjusting the straps so that you can have a better experience but personally I don’t like the plastic part on the back so I bought a better strap just make sure when buying Accessories you check the reviews and size this es 2 are very important. And that’s all I guess so don’t listen to other bad reviews there headsets probably came damaged or broke in 1 day after throwing the controller by accident this is the review you should listen to"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,no hay mejor compra que esta,"Hay contadas ocasiones en la vida que uno ve que gasto bien la plata, esta es una de esas, estas gafas son perfectas, el costo está bien, la calidad de la imagen es muy buena los juegos son muy buenos si se quieren juegos mas exigentes y economicos se pueden conectar inalambricamente al pc, pero la verdad la gran mayoria del tiempo las uso standalone tanto para hacer ejercicio como para jugar algo o ver algun video, me encanta la realidad virtual pero en dispositivos anteriores como el vive o usar directamente el celular se sentia muy baja la calidad y que en general era muy costoso su uso, con estas oculus quest 2 no tengo queja alguna funcionan muy bien, excelente"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great upgrade from the Vive,"I’ve owned the original Vive and this is a huge upgrade. The tracking, resolution, size, weight, and quality are all amazing for the price. Being fully wireless and portable makes this such a huge advancement over PC tethered headsets. It also has an excellent microphone which is great for games like VRChat. If it’s financially possible for you I do highly recommend the elite strap (with battery!) and the link cable. The battery drains quickly (around 2 hours play) and the link cable will allows you more performance when it’s needed."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Good product. The kids love it.,"We have used an Oculus at my brother-in-law‘s. And my son loved it and kept asking for it for Christmas. It is more than the cost we spend on a Christmas gift for anyone child. So I bought it for the family. And although my youngest son plays at the most, everybody does. Except myself who gets dizzy easy. Quality seems good, we’ve had no issues with it. There were no instructions to tell you how to start setting it up other than just turn it on after charging it and it walks you through it which you don’t find out until you do it. Playtime seems short. Hopefully they come up with an additional battery pack you can attach to the goggles itself. It Would make it better."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It’s a ton of fun,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas but I set it up with my FB account. I was not on Facebook previously. I do have 4 different email accounts. Two are primary depending on where I use them. The others are backups like came free from my ISP. So I signed up to Facebook with one of my other accounts. Then connected it to my daughter’s iPad, not a phone. Pairing it with a mobile device gives you the ability to view what the person playing the game is seeing. You can also browse games and make purchases in the app.It’s a ton of fun and quickly became popular among the family. Now I ordered a second one but direct from Oculus since no one has them in stock and I’m not willing to pay twice as much money to a third party here. We can wait a month."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The future of social entertainment,"Th Quest 2 is hands down the best gaming console i’ve bought in my life and it’s not even a console, with this small beauty you can play lots of games, watch movies and stream from your pc, the real magic of the VR world however is in the immersion it gives when you’re with other players online, this is truly a future like experience that everyone should try, and it’s perfect for these times where is harder to see each other, when you put this headset on you will believe you are indeed in the virtual realm and hang out and play with your friends. And if you’re not interested in the social side, worry not, there are amazing single player games to enjoy with experiences that a controller will never give you. After having the Quest 2 it has been honestly really hard for me to go back to regular 2D gaming and boring chat boxes!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing! Got me into VR,"I have played vr in the past because my friend is a big vr enthusiast. I never wanted to get a vr system in the past because they were so expensive and setting up trackers around the room wasn’t really doable where I currently live. Then my friend told me about the quest 2 which is competitive with the  valve index but for only $300. I was skeptical that they must have cheaped out bad somewhere or it would be glitchy or slow. But no, it runs like a dream and even works with pc for 120hz. All the tracking is done in the headset and has never glitched for me. It also works standalone without a pc although I mainly play pcvr since a lot of the games I play with my friends are on pc. This headset works great and it’s an INSANE piece of technology for the price."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Wireless VR is incredible,"Previously owned a traditional PCVR headset, that while I totally loved, having to deal with the cable management was a real pain in my already limited space.The Quest 2 is a perfect solution that problem. Being able to play Beat Saber, Pavlov, or Boneworks without worrying about a cable to trip over is such a nice feeling. I purchased the Virtual Desktop software and just stream my pc to my headset to play PCVR only games. I'm lucky enough to have good internet and a good router, so my wireless streaming experience has been pretty much flawless. Your mileage may vary on your specs or ISP!The Facebook login dilemma is a bit annoying, sure, but with how connected I already am via my phone and other devices, one more device eating all of my personal info was not a huge concern. That being said, I can totally see why someone would avoid this! (Though if you're determined enough, there are ways to block them from gathering any info)"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Increíble opción para VR,"Esta consola, porque funciona como una consola independiente, ha cambiado totalmente mi perspectiva con respecto a la realidad virtual. Me encantan la oferta de juegos, los controles son muy cómodos, la batería dura lo que debería durar (2 horas continuas aprox.), los sensores son muy precisos, y la actividad física y el seguimiento de este aspecto es muy informativo para poder saber cuantas calorías y minutos he gastado haciendo ejercicio con el visor puesto. Excelente portabilidad y comodidad al tener las gafas puestas. Una consola VR muy recomendada si lo que quieres es entrar a la realidad virtual sin necesidad de cables, ni una PC potente que pueda correr juegos VR."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Finally, i got the chance to got one / PCVR is definitly a whole new level for gaming","I wanted to buy it on november-december last year, i couldn't, it was sold out on amazon, i waited nearly a month, pressing F5 every goddamm day waiting until amazon got re-stock. It got here about 3 weeks ago, and am using it on a dayily basis.I have a pretty decent rig, so i knew i wanted to jump in the wagon of HMDs to be able of PCVR. My options where this and a Rift S. This one has IPD adjustment, better overall resolution, and of course you can use it umplugged which works for all kinds of people, not only gamers like the first rift or the VIVE. My wife who's not a gamer tried it out with roller coaster and got fascinated like a child.Right now am using the link to play on PC, i know you have to option to go wireless too, which is another reason that this has better value than the rift S. But i guess that is a project for the future since my router is downstairs and the wi-fi signal its not too stable.Awesome product, if you don't care about FB sing-in, when you play HL alyx on this, believe me, FB policies doesn't matter that much, its a 300 bucks high resolution headset, i mean what else do you want??"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Bricking Risk - Do Not Buy. (UPDATE),Bricking risk. Do NOT buy this oculus guest 2 if you care about the bricking risk associated with the facebook banning pandemic. I never had a Facebook account and was required to sign up for one to use the quest 2...got blocked at sign up (fully compliant account details but AI decided to ban me upfront for violation of community guidelines.... However that is possible?). Now the guest 2 is a paperweight with NO way to use it. There's also no one that can or want to fix the issue (not even oculus). Just google oculus facebook banning issue for reference of just how bad this is.UPDATEI managed to reach out to Oculus and get someone from support to try and assist. After few mails back and forth the support people came back and said that they have spoken to Facebook about issue and someone from Facebook would contact me. The same day I received a mail from Facebook to say that I'm not banned anymore and that I can continue to use it as before.I know others weren't so lucky. but for the moment it would seem that Oculus did resolve the issue for me at least. Kidos to them for helping out when it seemed that the matter was lost.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Very Good VR For A Very Good Price,"I cannot stress enough how much I love my Quest 2! The visuals are jaw-dropping, and the controls are smooth and responsive. Being completely wireless and untethered is simply amazing, and now you can wirelessly run pcvr games, so the link cable isn't necessary (as long as you have really good wifi and internet). The Quest 2 makes high-end quality VR affordable and accessible and I cannot recommend it enough.One of the greatest things about the Quest 2 is that you don't need a television, xbox, playstation, or even a computer to play it! (Unless you want to play pc games on it, of course lol.) It is a completely standalone system with just the headset and the two controllers, and with it's incredible hand tracking, you don't even need the controllers 😆! Ok, you do need the controllers, because, unfortunately, the remote-less hand tracking is unique to the Quest and there aren't many games that support it yet. It's still a fun little gimmick to play with, though.There are two cons to the system, however, in my experience. One is that the default headset strap makes it very front-heavy, which can get uncomfortable after extended periods of use.The second is that the battery only lasts about 2-3 hours at a time before needing recharged.Both of these issues can be resolved with the replacement pro strap accessory that has the added battery pack in the back.TL/DR; Very good for very cheap"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great VR for a great price.,"I was nervous about getting a stand-alone VR Headset. Then I read about PC link (I bought a 3rd party one and it worked fine.) and this would allow me to play PC Steam VR games as well as the Oculus Rift titles. Does it work Oh my yes it does with the 90Hz update the PC VR games are smooth. You have to have a VR capable PC which I do.  However to get the most bang for your buck and make this one of the single best VR headsets out there. You need to purchase the virtual Desktop app and get Side quest and do what it tells you to do to get VR Patch for virtual desktop and If you have a Gigabit Router. I got a cheap one on here for less than 50 Bucks. What that allows you do from there is play your PC VR games wirelessly. Fallout VR, SkyRim VR what ever you want and it works fantastic. It is worth every penny and there are plenty of strap and Battery extender options for any budget. This is the time to get into VR. What some people consider a downside is the required Facebook account but I have one already so I don't care this head set rocks."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,WOW!,"The first time I tried VR was on a friends Oculus Rift S and his beefy PC, a set up that cost him about 2 grand. Not long ago I tried another friends original Oculus quest, both of those experiences where mind blowing. I have wanted to get the original Oculus quest for some time now but I held off, I am glad that I did, I bought this thing as soon as I saw it advertised, I haven't had for long so I can't speak to its longevity but I will definitely update this if I notice any problems with it. The resolution per eye is higher than even the valve index, a $1000 dollar headset that still requires a good gaming PC to run properly, the 72-90hz display is not amazing but it's more than acceptable. Tracking is very accurate and feels very good. I have noticed that everyone is more or less prone to motion sickness but mostly it depends on what you are doing or what game you are playing. However, it does require you to login to Facebook, this personally does not bother me, however, if it does bother you, look elsewhere, and whatever you do, do not use a fake facebook account as if facebook finds out that you are using a fake account they will ban you and you will lose access to all the games and software that you payed money for. Overall this headset offers a very good experience, it is ideal for any who wants to try VR but does not have a powerful PC, or for someone who want a fully wireless VR experience, amazing."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"No sensors, no wires, no pc, no limits!",I owned the original oculus rift and decided to get the quest 2 because I was tired of setting up and fixing my senors in my small bedroom everytime I wanted to play! With the quest 2 you have everything you need and simply have to draw your play space and you're ready to go! I felt like that made it easier for playing in small spaces. On top of that if you get a link cable (I recommend KRX) you can hook up to your PC and it'll work like a pc vr headset! But wait there's more! There's a new beta feature called airlink which means you don't need the cable anymore either!!! The headset comes in an awesome looking box that's great for storage so you don't even need to get a carrying case (unless you want something smaller!) I love my quest headset and recommend it to any gamer
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I love my new Oculus!,"Ok so before I bought my oculus quest 2 I was reluctant because of all the Boomers hating in the reviews. However I ignored them and purchased. All I can say is,  I love my headset gaming and watching movies is amazing. I highly recommend you buying this you wont regret it. Oculus has a huge library of games. Entertainment, internet browsing in VR and educational vr experiences. There is literally something for everyone. Great for a family. Great excersize! However I do recommend buying a sweat proof faceplate for your headset. Because you will be sweating after 20 min of nonstop activity. (A side note) VERY IMPORTANT... the battery life is roughly 2 hours long. And if your into grinding or long sessions i recommend buying a type c extender cord and a Anker portable charger, you'll be able to game all day. In conclusion, this is the best purchase ive made this year. I can't understand the hate. It does require Facebook, so what. You can not stop progress. The future is now, and if you want to experience it with this headset it requires you to use Facebook. Boomers are just being angry Boomers."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing Headset for the Price,"The Oculus Quest 2 is the real deal. It has clear visuals, a snappy interface, excellent stationary and roomscale tracking, and ergonomic controllers.New games, apps, and experiences get added to the Oculus Store every week, so you'll never run out of things to do. Also, if you have a high end PC, you can even play PC VR games like Half Life Alyx, Skyrim VR, and Fallout 4 VR by picking up the link cable or wirelessly (using the Virtual Desktop app).The only negative I can see with this headset is the requirement to have a Facebook account in order to use it, but that wasn't a big deal for me. The battery life also isn't spectacular, so I'd recommend picking up the Elite Headstrap with battery pack if you plan on playing for more than 2 hours at a time.Overall, this is an amazing VR headset for the price. If you're on the fence about picking this up, just buy it. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Has a Love hate kinda connection with steam.,To use this with your steam game you need a Oculus Link cable and the app Virtual Desktop and its computer counter part downloaded so that the system can connect to your computer to play steam games. The link cable has to be connected the entire playtime with steam games or the system starts to lag heavily. You will also need plenty of light to use this think of people saying that you need light to watch tv that kind  of light amount will suffice.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Quest 2- Replacement for CV1!,"I have the CV1, oculus Go, and PSVR. I have to say Im very pleasently surprised how far technology has come over the span of only a few years. Easily, hands down, the Oculus Quest 2 Is my replacement over the CV1 rift. The clarity is so great, hardly any screen door effect. The pass through feature is amazing when setting up boundaries, the motion controllers are fluid and react great.So i guess ill be tearing down my oculus rift sensors , packing away the rift and selling it because this paired with a oculus link wire does the job and i can play it through the pc and portable.Beatsaber is fluid, Pistol Whip plays very well, i cant wait to load up walking dead saints and sinners on it, it is going to be great!  I highly recommend this!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blown Away!,"I wanted to get this last year - but decided that the price point was too high for something that I wasn't too sure about.  At the $300 price point, this year I decided it was worth the gamble.  Every member of my family was absolutely blown away.  This is EXTREMELY realistic.  I'm amazed that we can have access to this level of technology for $300.Biggest limitation/criticism is the battery.  Takes about 2-hours to fully charge.  A fully charged battery lasts about 2-hours.  For kids that don't habitually limit themselves to appropriate, finite periods of screen time, these 2-hour limits are actually a blessing in disguise.  But it is frustrating when you want to use it only to realize that someone just drained the battery and now you have to wait.Other criticism is that it doesn't utilize any sort of ""account"" system.  Unless the individual games have their own, individual save files, it does not really accommodate, say, having multiple people do their own campaign in Beat Saber.  Also, I'm OK with having to tie this into my facebook account - you can disable all of the connections that would make typically make this annoying.  I just don't like the fact that when my wife and kids starting using it, they basically have access to my facebook account when they do.  However, since they're only playing games, it doesn't really end up being that big of a deal."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best value in VR,Received mine today. Crystal clear screen and great motion tracking. I had saw on some reviews that the headset is not comfortable but after using it for an hour I've had no issues.Only negative I'll say so far is the 2 hour battery life goes quickly! My son and I were taking turns playing it and before we knew it we already needed to put it on the charger.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Why go back to reality?,"Who cares if FB owns it. Everything about your information is already out there one way or another. To have a device free from wires and yet still be plugged into a conputer for PCVR games is amazing. I tried the PSVR but I dislike the move Controller. The joy stick on each hand is what should be standard, if it isnt already. For the 100 dollar price difference from 64 to 256, theres no question, get the more memory. Overall, im looking to get thr battery extender to counter balence the front. Its not huge issue by any means (every vr headset will have wight, regardless) but If the headset and controller is 90% then this battery extender/back head strap is the last 10%"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"My Son says: ""BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER MOM!!!""","I remember getting a handheld Beauty and the Beast multi-level game when I was 9 years old and thinking that that was the finest piece of technology I had ever seen. Now we are literally standing in our living room killing zombies in The Walking Dead and going on roller coaster rides and in vrchat talking to people from all over the world. This is the coolest thing ever! Everyone in the house is thrilled about my son's Christmas present, and he is happy to share with everyone!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Incredible!,"I haven’t been this excited about a product in awhile. It’s incredible!! I got it for my kids but bought myself one when I saw what it can do. I never play video games, I’ve been to the movie theater once since 2014, and watch one tv series a year, so I’m not really into this stuff usually. But after seeing VR I’m hooked. I love being able to travel to art museums, see historical sites, watch documentaries with  iMax feeling, travel through space. I had no idea what could be done with VR or why Facebook paid a fortune for Oculus until now. I could see this replacing other forms of home entertainment—why watch a tv, or use a game console, or even surf the web on your phone, when the VR experience is so much better."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,great entry device to vr,"This is a very popular device, mainly because of it's price. I know a lot of friends who also have one. You can pretty much do with this device everything you could with a non google android like a fire tablet. It has Facebook app store, apps/games aren't cheap and they look like you would imagine on a modern android phone, but it's very fun. I've spent hours in beat saber, the climb and even the getting started tutorial app. The display is great and you can stream your PC, a wifi6 router is recommended for lower latency. No cables is an amazing value by itself. The elite strap with the battery is a great addon to extend gameplay. Headphones with a short aux cable are also a great adding. Bluetooth is supported but it will have an audio lag. Beat saber modding is possible but with constant warnings from Facebook store that it's considered piracy and they can just block you and take away your games very easily. With all that said, if you don't have a vr device: this one is well worth it. It is unlikely mobile GPUs will advance significantly enough for you to wait for a newer model, this one is fully capable and feels very well tuned already. With an external battery it really feels as good as it can get and not in a bad way, just don't expect it to defy the laws of physics, it's still a phone on your face."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Works well!,"I got this as a 'cheap' entry into VR. I got the link cable as well for PC play. (And I say cheap, as some competitors ranged from 600$ to over 1000$!)I will say that VR isn't perfect. But it's way more fun that I was expecting!I was a bit worried, as I'd read in some reviews you needed a facebook account and people were having issues. However I was able to create one without a problem in a few minutes. I have little interest in facebook, so I don't really understand why you need an account, but despite that, it wasn't difficult to get it setup. I'm glad I made the purchase, it has resulted in some fun, unique experiences!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Perfect gift & better priced than earlier Quest,"This just arrived, we love it!  We've had experience with the earlier version of Ocular Quest, and this one is just as good, but also better in some ways. The hand grips are comfortable, and the goggles have a good range of vision in all directions. I personally like the white color better than the original black color, but I know that doesn't relate to performance.The Oculist Quest 2 performs well, responds rapidly, and gives a great VR experience. It's fairly easy to use, and comes with a few games to get you started. With 256gbs, it offers more than the earlier Quest models.I purchased this as a gift for my son, and after just one day, we are both enjoying it. I may get another for myself!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Too cool,I am a supreme novice on VR but am so impressed. Learning new things to do everyday that I use it. I am definitely outside of the target market area but this is great. Have purchased a few apps and acquired several of the free ones that come from Oculus. Be ready for motion issues especially when you are up in the International Space Station. Keep telling yourself it's only a game when you have a T-Rex roaring two feet in front of your face. The one drawback I have found is a challenge to find directions or explanation of game icons (at least to me). The app Wander is an example. There are icons but I am not sure I know what to do with them. I will eventually figure it out but a little frustrating.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing all in one virtual reality,"I feel that it must be said, majority of the negative reviews this headset is getting are not actually about the headset, but rather about Facebook, and their shenanigans. The headset itself is amazing. I've only used the original Rift before, and it was mindblowing how much I like this headset better. First, it's actually got better picture quality and immersion, without needing to be tethered to a PC. Second, the built in cameras make it an absolute breeze to set up your play zone. It literally takes seconds to move from one area to another, from a full room play, to stationary sitting VR. For the price, this device is incredible. I've been playing beatsaber on it until my face is so sweaty, I can't see properly anymore. I would highly recommend this VR headset to anyone that doesn't want to mess with stationary sensor setup, or is looking to a device to first experience VR without having to worry about other devices."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Portable and great for family fun night!,"Great VR headset if you are looking for affordable and family entertainment.It does take some getting used to if you have never experienced VR before. I really like how you can play certain games standing or sitting makes it a bit more comfortable for the user.You can cast what the player is seeing in game to your phone which is a great feature, there is a way to cast it to the TV which I currently do not have the capability.CON: The only thing that I would say is a let down is the battery life. You will only get between 2-3 hours use per charge and it roughly takes 2.5 hours to completely charge. Oculus does sell an Elite Strap with a battery extender which will double your play time for $129, which at some point I will probably purchase."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Wow, just WOW!!","I've been pondering getting a VR headset for a couple years. I wanted a good quality item that could do wireless, high resolution VR graphics. Finally decided to bite the bullet got the Oculus Quest 2. Wow, just wow is all I can say. It took me a bit to learn how to navigate through the interface but the whole time I was figuring this out I kept thinking ""Damn this is Bad ASS!"". This product is amazing so if you're in the market you won't be disappointed!JEC"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Worth it.,"Worth every penny. Takes a bit of time to go around and find what you like game wise so I suggest you do some YouTubeing on what games you would like before going into the store to stop you from spending unnecessary cash (which it’s very easy) only con is the battery runs out very quick around 2 hours which flies when you are having fun.I heard bad things about the strap but it doesn’t bother me one bit. Maybe it’s because I have a bigger head it fits really nice and does not move when my head movesBelow are some reviews on games I ownBeatSaber:It’s fun but not worth the price tag. Default soundtracks are songs I’ve never heard of and the ones worth playing you need to buy each track individually or the album. Tracks are 1.99 album 14.99Onward:Military tactical shooter, really cool and a lot of teamwork to win. Prep takes a bit and rounds are quick but keeps you on your toes wondering who is around the cornerBlaston:By far the best game I own. 9.99 price tag but it keeps you moving the whole time. SmileOn my face the whole time I’m playing."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing for the price,This thing works very very well. The price also can't be beat. The only way it makes sense is that it's sold at a loss. They most likely make more money off the oculus store and potentially selling your data since it links to your facebook.This thing is amazing though and I already had facebook on my phone/pc anyway so I'm aware I'm giving up some of my privacy.The refresh rate of 90 is good and the resolution is one of the highest of any VR headset. I have no idea how they got the price down to $299 but they did it somehow.Personally I prefer to play games from my pc wireless with virtual desktop or with the link cable. This thing can play games standalone but it's basically just using a cell phone chip for that which is not going to give you good graphics. It's amazing it works at all standalone with the resolution and refresh rate though so I'm definitely not complaining and standalone mode is fine for certain types of games. I just don't think you'll get the best experience without a decent pc.Guardian mode is solid and it tracks your location very well and warns you when you are walking into obstacles. You can also double tap the oculus and see out of the cameras which is really nice. So far everything has worked pretty flawlessly. Definitely incredibly impressed for the price.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oculus 2: Great for the whole family!,"My son used his holiday money to purchase an Oculus 2 and it was projected to come at the end of January. Well a few days later we got a wonderful email that the delivery was coming the next day!!!! From order to received it was 6 days. Awesome! I LOVE the oculus. I’m in my late 30s and hubby mid 40s and we can’t get enough of it. We all bought a game and so far like Myst, Dance Central and Beat Sabre. Sooooo now I’m buying my own because I can play Dance Central for 1.5 hours and we want to buy exorcist. The list keeps on growing."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing gaming experience!,"The Oculus quest 2 is a completely different gaming experience! When you play it feels like you’re in a completely different world with endless possibilities.The games are so fun. Super hot is a must have . On console it’s a pretty cool game , but on VR it becomes a completely different and more amazing game .The only con I have to say is the battery life .It’s not the longest lasting , but it works and has a decent amount of play time before charging is required .The only reason it has bad reviews is because of people who hate Facebook . ITS POWERED BY FACEBOOK AND IT SAYS SO ON THE BOX. People act surprised that it requires a Facebook account when it was never a hidden detail . Ignore the bad reviews"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Wireless is nice..,"So did a lot of research and decided to buy this in spite of the forced Facebook login. I was impressed right from the start. I previously owned an original Vive, and wanted to upgrade, but go wireless also. This did the trick.I started off with some free games, then connected it wirelessly to my PC to play my Steam VR games. That works great most of the time.Next, I invest in silicone controller grips with hand straps. Then a few paid games directly on the Quest. Now I ordered a Halo head strap for it. Next will be a battery extender. I'm invested now. Wireless is nice, but I still don't like the Facebook login requirement."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Oculus Quest 2 is the clearest looking, easiest to set up and use, and best-value you can buy","I have been a fan of VR for many years, and have had before my Quest 2 an Oculus Developer Kit 2, a Playstation VR, and an Acer H101 Windows Mixed Reality headset.Oculus Quest 2 blows these out of the water and I think I have used it more in the past week than I used the other headsets overall.What is amazing about it is the high resolution of the display. The optics and visuals are so clear on this headset, with no ""screen-door"" effect where you can see the spaces between the pixels. Reading text went from a real pain on other VR headset, where it is hard enough that most applications use really big text when you need to read things, to being crystal clear even at small text sizes. It really can't be understated how much of an upgrade this is over previous generation VR headsets with regards to the display, making absolutely everything more comfortable and enjoyable.Another amazing thing about the device is that it is a powerful all-in-one system with no wires. All of my other VR headsets require wires to connect to a computer or playstation, and most also have additional wires going to sensors set up around the room to capture your action. The Quest 2 instead is self-contained and tracks from the inside-out, so you need no setup except for putting on the headset and using the controls to draw a ""safe-space"" that headset will use to alert you before you knock into a wall or your expensive Ming Vase. But just because it is an all-in-one doesn't mean that's all it can do; it can also hook up to a powerful VR-ready computer to do PC-based games, too. It truly is the best of both worlds, unlocking my previous library of VR games and a new library of new amazing content built for the Quest 2.The final thing that I love about this is that the applications have become really impressive. It took a second, but there have finally come some great VR games, including some amazing multiplayer ones. Some highlights are Beat Saber, SuperHot, Dash Dash World Racing, Population: One, and Journey of the Gods, to name only a small portion of the fun games in available.If you are interested even the slightest bit in VR, get the Oculus Quest 2. You will not regret it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Excellent for working out - Lots of fun games,"My brother bought one and after trying it, I bought one on the spot.Pros:It's so much fun and very realistic. While playing a rollercoaster game, I actually had to sit down for fear of falling over. It was so lifelike!Also, unintentionally it's become a great workout routine. I absolutely hate working out, but the games are so interactive and immersive that you won't even realize you're burning calories.There are great game options and even many free games, but don't forget it's not just for games. There are so many VR videos that allow you to swim under the ocean, float in space, and experience places around the world. Some videos are accessible through the main library, while others can be viewed simply by navigating to YouTube.Cons:The main negative I've found is that the battery only lasts for about two hours. For this reason, I also purchased the upgraded head strap and extended battery, which now allow me to get nearly four hours of continual play. This is especially helpful when family members want to play one after another.The AA batteries that came with the hand controllers seem to be dying faster than my brother's are, but I do play different games than him, so perhaps the games I play use the vibration feature in the controllers more. Still, I've had the console for nearly one month and play at least an hour daily, if not several hours throughout the day, so that's not bad for one AA batter in each controller.Lastly, while you're playing and working up a sweat, the lenses can start to get slightly fogged up. It would be nice if there were some type of ventilation between your face and the lenses, especially if you wear glasses. However, again, this is not a deal breaker by any means, and it's easy enough to pause a game, take the headset off, and wipe everything down before continuing to play."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Impressive,"My kid saved and saved for this and is 100 percent happy with it!  My husband was impressed with the quality & how real it actually felt.  I am glad for the boundaries so it keeps the boys, pets, & house safe... Also, I’m glad to see that the games are cheaper than those for gaming systems."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just get it.,"This is way more fun that I expected.  I just spent an hour walking through Star Wars, and you really feel like you are a part of the game.  The graphics are amazing, though I hope a future system adds eye tracking to prevent the need to turn your head to keep things in focus.  I recommend getting the 'elite' strap if more than one person is using - it is a pain to adjust the size of the strap otherwise!  Costs do add up - other than the fitness games, the titles look like they are good for a few hours of play each at $20 - $30/pop.  Note that if your company offers any sort of fitness incentives, VR gear like this typically qualifies - so that makes the decision easier."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"A great headset for cheap, and why you shouldn't care about the Facebook requirement","This is honestly a amazing headset. Sure its not the fanciest in some areas but its amazing price and unparalleled ability to play games not only wirelessly and without a pc is amazing.Some people might be turned off by the requirement of Facebook but, even though I am not a fan of Facebooks previous conduct related to data privacy, the fact of the matter is that if you use Amazon, Mastercard, or Google. That's not going to do anything. Companies sell data to each other all the time, and if your strategy was just not using Facebook it isn't going to work anyways."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Excellent vr experience. oculus tv definitely needs an improvement,Its an amazing stuff...it lets you in into the real world of gaming...Again i have seems comments on facebook accounts being linked which I personally have no issues...the quality of the games is excellent...the best part is you could return the game if you have not played it for more than 2 hours and feel that its not a right one for you...one issue i had was to get the lense and the straps to go together to get the best picture out of it...the other issue i had was the videos in the oculus tv which defentely needs improvement...for gaming this is an awesome vr...again please donot compare xbox to oculus as these two are different animals...
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing product,"OMG amazing!!! Virtual reality has come a long way! Easy to use, amazing quality.Must say we did not appreciate the holiday mark up. But, we were very thankful we were able to get it at the price we did.Had ordered one from another seller in October. Kept getting delay messages until the item simply slipped off my order list with not one notification. Tried everywhere and they were charging exorbitant prices.This seller was charging only slightly over versus others who were charging 4x original price.We are thankful we could get what we promised our child who worked very hard to earn it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Stunning VR tech at affordable price.,"Oculus Quest 2 is astonishing piece of VR technology and all in such a small and lightweight package at accessible price. Very responsive, fast device, improved LCD resolution and graphics. Several things I’d like to mention: I wish Oculus has expanded their game library to more titles and the headset strap included in the package is extremely uncomfortable (understandably to lower the retail price for the unit). So I’d strongly recommend ordering the elite strap by Oculus for more comfort, especially for longer gaming sessions: Other than that Oculus has achieved something unimaginable with Quest 2 - high quality VR experience at affordable price. This device is the beginning of actual VR revolution. Highly recommend. Two thumbs up."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Coolest thing I've ever bought. I finally have a Star Trek holodeck and it was only about $300!,"For me, it would have been worth it just for Beatsaber. Everything else is icing on the cake. I showed it to a relative of mine and she bought one the same day. Also, I expected to need my reader glasses since it's right on my face, and I wear readers even for the computer screen. But for some reason, I don't need the readers. And the fact that you can play other games not available in the Quest 2 store, by running them on my PC, is ice cream on the icing on the cake. I haven't even done it yet, but a friend of mine did, and was able to play at higher resolution than can be done on the Quest 2 itself. I am a happy customer!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,So much fun for the whole family!,"OK, there's only myself and my son but I love this THING!  I've purchased Beat Saber and lots of music and it's finally something that my teen son and I can do together and we are super competitive.  It's easy to learn, incredibly realistic, and so many options in games.  It's a must have!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best Game EVER! BUY THIS,"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS THING! It has a built in app store so you can get instant access to any games you want, plenty of demos to try out games before purchasing, and just the variety of things it can do is amazing! I definitely would say its something to show off and play with friends, you cant play/ hog it for hours on end since it does make you dizzy after some time and who knows how bad it is for your eyes but you can pick games based on your comport level and can also choose if you want to play sitting down (stationary) or moving around. Nice way to get a bit more active and off the couch! Love it and I'm definitely not a gamer!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best new gadget!,"I am a fan of all gaming gadgets. But this, this is the new leap into th next generation of gaming. But it's not just for gaming. Youtube, Netflix, Firefox, and other apps are accessible through the Oculus Quest 2. I purchased the 256 GB version to have plenty of space for all my apps and games. I will recommend leaving some money back for accessories for the device, such as handle grips, 16 ft. USB C cable, VR cover, elite head strap, and others to help make your experience more comfortable. Overall, this is a powerful next generation device and I highly recommend the Oculus Quest 2 to casual gamers and hardcore gamers alike. You won't regret it!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing!!!,Honestly if your thinking about getting one of these. Just do it. You will be impressed. Especially if you are like me and its your first vr headset. The graphics are impressive considering you are running this without any pc. But just being able to interact with items in a virtual world is so fun and it works so well!! I got the 256 gb model downloaded at least 12 games and still have 200 gb of storage.My only complaint and its not really a complaint. Is that you won't want to stop playing and the battery dies out after about 2.5 hours and it can take a good bit to charge back.Can be remedied with a charge pack or long cord.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Better than I anticipated.,"I had a rift CV1 and bought this with the link cable for something more versatile and it’s impressive even without the link cable to the PC. I was worried the inside out tracking wouldn’t be up to par with the rifts sensors but I can’t tell much difference.  They skimped on the head strap and the audio isn’t quite as immersive as the rifts earphones but I don’t usually play more than two hours at a time and it’s comfortable enough for that.  And FYI to everyone, you are not important enough to be spied on. Requiring a FB account also holds people accountable - a foreign concept these days. The people crying about needing a Facebook account and their precious data are the same people dropping the N word in all the online games you play.  They want your data so they can advertise kerosene and a wooden cross if you’ve been looking at buying a white hooded robe."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just buy it - this thing is AWESOME,"there's nothing to say about this other then, buy it. You're missing out if you don't.I had a q1 before, and compared to quest1, it's much more comfortable and the screen looks much better. Also the wifi chip is faster (which helps with wireless pcvr gaming)"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Excellent portable VR system,Cons:Yes you have to have a Facebook account.Yes the battery life isn’t great (about 2 hours).The included head strap isn’t the best. (I intend to purchase the elite strap as soon as they’re in stock)Built in speakers aren’t amazingPros.Very reasonable price.It’s completely wireless.Can be tethered to a decently specced pc to play steam VRVerdictDespite flaws I have found this to be an amazing product.  I Haven’t experienced anything like VR and I promise that seeing VR games on a flat screen don’t do it justice. I haven’t tried the competitions products to compare but the price difference is significant making this a great entry point for people interested in VR.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blown away!!!  So excited for what’s to come!!,This product has changed my life!!  The features and uses are insane. Everyone that I have over to try it out leaves speechless and buys one. I know 10 people have bought one after trying mine out. The Oculus 2 made so many improvements to make this a better rig. Ignore all the crybabies complaining about logging into Facebook. I’d bet they have 15 other accounts ties to Facebook and won’t admit it or don’t even know it. If you’re that concerned make a dummy Facebook account for this. I can’t wait for the future of VR!!!
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Great product, not as big of a jump from Q1 as I wanted","I've bought four Oculus Quests and three Quest 2s for myself and as gifts. Everyone is always blown away--I really love how much more clear text in other details are on the Q2, although I feel like the Q1 did better in other regards, like a more comfortable stock strap and better eye width adjustment. Most importantly, I think the Q1 has less fresnel lens glaring, which is super annoying for the Q2. The Q1 was a little more forgiving to stay in focus, while the Q2 has to be exact and any movement at all blurred details. The extra elite has strap is almost a requirement, which doesn't make the Q2 as attractive cost-wise."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Everyone should have one,"Ok... this is the most amazing machine on the planet. truely the wave of the future and every person should have one. It’s so realistic.. you can travel, play games... go to the movies and if you and a friend have one you both can meet up in the environment... don’t wait buy now.. you will never go back to regular video games. The shipping was fast, and it blew my family’s mind at Christmas... get one you will not be disappointed."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,$300 for a gaming system and gym membership? I'm in!,"I've never used VR before but wanted to give it a shot at this low entry cost.Wow.I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I absolutely love the fitness and media aspects of this device. I'm not even that much of a gamer, but the immersive experience VR provides has actually made me want to do more.If you're on the fence, jump over and you won't be disappointed."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Super fun!,"My 13yr old son bought this with his own birthday money. I was nervous to let him spend so much money on a gaming product but OMG is this thing amazing. I enjoy playing games and even doing workouts with it! It's a very impressive product and the 3D images are amazing. He's been using it for 3 months now and we have encountered zero problems. His skin did get red when he first started using it and I made him not use it for 24 hours until the redness went away. After a few more times of irritated red skin on his face, it's like his skin must have gotten ised to the goggles and he no longer gets red marks."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This is the single most impressive piece of tech I've ever owned,"I came from a CV1 to this. Blows it out of the water, and that's just on its mobile chip. I am honestly floored by what Facebook is doing with this technology. People can say what they want about them, but they appear to be the only company willing to bet huge on this market and it really shows.There is literally no other tech in the VR market that is in the same league as this headset. Yea, there Valve's index, but that runs on a $1000 computer and requires a base station setup.I literally turned it on, marked my play area in VR, and got right to it. The visuals are crisper than anything else I've seen yet barring these ultra premium headsets.The fact Facebook has such a huge lead on the tech and still has priced this so low, despite a total lack of competition in the standalone headset arena, is mind boggling. I love this device."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This is my second VR headset and this is a winner!,"I learned my lesson with my first cheap vr headset that only worked with my phone (DO NOT GET THAT TYPE). I figured if I wanted to get decent quality and be able to use it for the real vr experience then I would have to spend some money, but I'm not rich so the top of the line models are out of reach.I was extremely impressed with how good the Oculus Quest is for the cost, and continue to be amazed at how good the content and quality is. I did buy the upgraded headband, the one that came with it is not great, but that is really the only negative thing I can think of ."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A watcher,"I have been interested in virtual reality for many years but have held off buying a device. It appeared to me that the Oculus Quest 2 is the first that may actually become some type of a standard for VR development. I have been very impressed with the experience and so has my family. I think price, performance, and popularity have to converge for software producers to begin developing and optimizing a system. I hope the Quest 2 is it. I am also impressed with the latest software update that will allow the device to operate at faster frame rates."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Excellent Wireless PCVR Experience with 5GH Wifi!,"I purchased the Quest 2 for my first wireless PCVR experience via ""Virtual Desktop"". It's worth every penny to play Minecraft in VR (aka Vivecraft), Pavlov VR and VRChat, even though there is a lot of setup to get it running with SteamVR for the first time. I love this.As for the Quest software, the graphics are adequate in some game titles. I recommend Quest 2 over the Quest 1 by far."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing!,"This is an amazing device. It takes you to a whole new world. I was a bit skeptical at first because I’ve had other VR devices where you had to use your phone and they were a joke but this is completely different. I don’t like the fact that there isn’t a lot of good free apps/games, especially with this price tag, but the experience is worth it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,So much FUN,"I had heard a lot about the VR experience and the Quest 2 doesn't disappoint. I was attracted to the idea of standalone VR because I do not have a gaming computer. It's been a total blast to play with, but I do wish I had been more aware of the motion sickness aspect. While I was aware it could happen with flight games, I didn't know one could experience it in roaming games, so that is something I will have to overcome. Overall, it's totally worth the money to for this gaming experience and there are still games to play that don't make me feel ill until I get my VR legs."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Great price, fastest shipping!","We purchased Oculus 2s for our three boys. They absolutely love it!! Amazon had a competitive price, and we got the items via Prime in just a couple of days! I love Amazon!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blown my expectations away for the price,"As a longtime follower of the vr space I've always been excited for the commercial options available. However I'm from south africa and locally the price of mainstream hardware has always been out of reach. So as the industry grew from the early days of devkit 1 I watched from the sideline waiting, with small experiences here and there including Google cardboard and similar concepts, to a 5 minute demo of the HTC vive back in 2019. Finally, after being rewarded for buying Dogecoin earlier this year I ordered my quest 2. I watched every youtube video mentioning vr in anticipation as my package spent a week traveling across the Atlantic ocean. Then it happened, UPS arrived with my quest 2. After practically putting every athletic record to shame as I rushed inside and tore open the packaging, there it was. Without pausing to breathe I popped it on and pressed the power button. I was blown away. I felt like I had just been transported to a different world. The inside out tracking system works way better than I could have anticipated, and the precision and latency are so impressive I see this as the ultimate future for VR. Using airlink with my PC works so well I'd never be able to tell I wasn't tethered by a high-speed cable. With a wide set of usecase options here, this device really is revolutionary, and coming in at such a low cost is just game changing( helping to ease the Facebook concerns somewhat). While not completely perfect, there's a lot that it gets right, but it is still worth mentioning the cons: lower fov than I'm comfortable with, pixel density is good but I'd expect it to be a focus to improve in future devices, the default strap is unfortunately terrible, the IPD adjustments are not very satisfactory, and the overall vibrancy and contrast of the display are not as impressive as oled options. As it stands right now there are definitely compromises, but for anyone considering vr that isn't prepared to spend an insane amount for alternative headsets (which also definitely do have their own compromises too) then this is an easy recommendation. I look very forward to where this goes in the future because it seems like many of the hardware compromises are currently a point of focus internally at both oculus and many of the competitors. But the experience available today with this product certainly is one to appreciate and I have absolutely no regret in my purchase after this first month of owning it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This Is The Future!,"Just imagine when VR becomes more standardize in terms of technology, it will become cheaper to build and use!  Especially if one wants to avoid another costly pandemic for people's livelihoods!  Got this under the recommendation from a friend.Some of the games are hard to use than others.  Imagine this brand of VR technology, whether it be the Oculus or other similar devices can be part of the household.  The only downside of the device is that it drains power very fast and must be charged often.  Hopefully future versions will correct that issue."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Do not buy Elite strap-battery, Quest link or usb cable. BUY VIRTUAL DESKTOP for wireless PCVR","Amazing piece of hardware. Do not be fooled by youtubers that get a commission to help oculus sell expensive mods for extra ""comfort"", the quest 2 with the original strap is super comfortable as is, you can rest you head anywhere with this system, in your gaming chair for example, you cannot with a bulky piece of plastic.Quest Link or USB cable: DO NOT BUY, the better experience is with virtual desktop for 20 USD, is amazing piece of software, you will be able to stream your entire pc and pc vr games in virtual reality to your quest 2. You just buy virtual desktop from oculus store, then download sidequest on your pc and search for virtual desktop there, you then install a patched version that will be able to stream all your pcvr games to your quest 2, it works fabulous, a complet wireless experience. This is it.Elite strap with battery: DO NOT BUY the super expensive elite strap with battery, you will only get around 2 hours or less if you use virtual desktop for wireless PCVR but you can use your standard power bank to charge it, its possible to charge with a power bank and play simultaneously and you can put your  powerbank in your pants or jacket pocket and it will be infinitely more comfortable that have it on your head with the elite strap.Those expensive accessories are just so facebook can recover money from the standard 299 hardware, NOT NEEDED.The only downside in the end is that you are forced to login with facebook and you will have big brother aka Zuckerberg, knowing your every move and selling your private info and private life to 3rd parties.Reverb G2:  I had this preorder as well,fortunately connect cancelled my pre-order on their own, if they had not, I would have had to do it, with quest 2 and wireless pcvr with virtual desktop for only $320 I am completely set, I had the rift S and and quest 2 is better face to face, bit even better than a complete wireless experience can be achieved with virtual desktop, and the batter issue can be resolved with a cheap powerbank, just a cable form the quest 2 to your pocket which is still wireless and you can overcome the battery issue which is a con for those that want to have long gaming session vs casuals that only play small game and a media of 1 hour.Forget Reverb G2, buy this!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Much better than Quest 1, still worse than PCVR","This is now a legitimate wireless VR headset. The Quest 1 was okay for single-player, slimmed-down games. But the Quest 2 can handle some PvP and hang in there. (For example, Rec Room runs a lot better on the Quest 2 than the Quest 1.)The Quest 2 still isn't close to the performance I get from my PCVR, but for what you pay for it, it's really great.I'm sure you could guess that the default headstrap is garbage, considering they're offering an upgrade. Well, it is garbage. Rather than buying their upgrade, I attached the Vive DAS to it, using a 3d printed part. That improves both the comfort and the audio quality.Battery life is as advertised. For a longer play session, I plug it in using a cord that goes down the back of the headset into a battery in my pocket. That way I don't add weight to my head."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Next level!!!,"Wow!!!!! That's the first words out of your mouth when you fire it up. The environment is amazing!!! The MoCap tracking is excellent. The depth and feel is excellent!!! The battery life leaves a bit to be desired but as a wireless setup, it's a solid 3hrs before you need to charge again. I do recommend the ""comfort"" accessory to relive the pressure off the front of your forehead. Again, it's essentially a gaming PC crammed into a small space that sits on your face. Overall, fantastic product and a comparable means to get into VR without a pricey PC build."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing piece of hardware!!!,"I've been a gamer for 15+ years now. I've heard of VR, but was never really interested in it until I tried a quest 2 at my brother's house. I thought it was absolutely amazing, so I ordered one the very next day.So far, I've had it a week, and haven't touched any of my other systems since I've gotten it. The fact that you can play wirelessly without having to be connected to anything is amazing. You can however connect to your PC with an oculus link cable and play VR games that aren't available on the quest 2 by itself.As much as I love the thing, I do have a few complaints. The head strap it comes with is garbage. I highly recommend ordering an elite strap or the very least, some other knock off brand. The difference it makes is incredible.The other complaint is the foam piece against your face. I'm not the biggest fan. It collects sweat super easily and makes my glasses fog up (speaking of which, the glasses spacer it comes with works well and allows enough room to wear the headset comfortably).However you can order the pleather one off the oculus store for $30. Still waiting on mine to come in before I have any thoughts on this.Now, idk what alien technology they put in those controllers, but my AA batteries last FOREVER. I've been using them for about 8 hours a day for the past week and the single battery used in each controller isn't even below 80%. *Insert mind blown gif here*Overall, this is an amazing piece of technology, especially for the price. If you're debating on getting this or have tried VR in the past and had sickness from it, give the Quest 2 a go. My buddy came over and was very hesitant in trying it because he didn't want to feel sick again. He played a couple intense games for about 30 minutes, and he said he didn't feel sick once and is going to get one. I think it's because of the OLED lens and the 90hz refresh rate."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,WOW,"Take your time to see what this can actually do. The options are endless. You can actually go on the internet and shop on Amazon. The games are plentiful and the graphics are fantastic. Don't be scared about the price. I promise you it is better than the ""regular"" gaming systems. Ok parents watch your kids on this. They can access things that may be inappropriate for their age. Adults watch your significant others for the same reason LOL.  The  ability to play multiplayer games with friends and family around the country in real time is also fantastic. Have fun!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Money well spent,"One of the best $300 purchases in a long time. It’s so immersive to play within the Oculus world. I do just fine with the 64Gb memory oculus myself. I imagine the games will get even better as time passes and more memory will be required, but for now for a occasional gamer I’m happy. If you’re considering just go ahead and pull the trigger you won’t regret it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Wireless VR is the Future!,"This is the best way to experience VR. The quality of the display is so crisp, such a massive upgrade from previous headsets. The tracking of the controllers is much better than I ever expected, I've never lost tracking once on this device and I've played plenty of high speed games that require very quick movements. The wireless freedom you get is unexplainable it just feels like you are completely immersed in the world you're in without a cord bringing you out of the immersion every once in a while. This is by far the best way to experience VR and I don't think I could ever go back to a wired setup. Oh and did I mention you can stream your PCVR games straight to the headset with Virtual Desktop and have next to no latency (with the proper internet setup and PCVR ready machine)? That's right, Wireless PCVR! Count me in!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Great buy especially if you're not in a ""first world"" country","To my knowledge Amazon is the only way to obtain a quest 2 legitimately if you live outside the countries where it is distributed in retail. I've been wanting to buy one for months but have been stopped by its unavailability in my country and the closed frontiers prevented me from buying it elsewhere.And yeah the product in itself is great. While the Valve index is arguably better, you can't beat that price for a well rounded standalone vr headset, especially for beginners like me who don't own a vr ready desktop.You do have to sell your soul to Facebook though, that is one big choice to consider, but imo doesn't prevent me from giving the Oculus Quest 2 the highest score (if selling your soul to Facebook is the price to pay to make VR more accessible and mainstream, so be it)"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Definitely  was a good buy! Highly recommend,This was my first VR gaming system and I was apprehensive about which one to get. I’m not a PC gamer but love PS4 and Xbox. After reading up on what is out there the choice seemed obvious to me that the Oculus Quest 2 was the right choice.So far I am very impressed. It been a little over a month and it is clear I made the right choice for me.I love the wireless functionality and the headset is just a tad heavier than I expected. It does take some adjustment to get used to the weight but it seems minimal. Everything I e looked at as far as games and apps is very fun to me. I did have to limit my time in VR for the first couple of weeks to get used to the movement. It left me a slight bit queasy after about an hour of use. At about 3 weeks that mostly went away. Battery life is around 2 and half hours. I did buy an aftermarket head strap that is more comfortable than the one that comes with the headset.I wear glasses and did put in the spacer and use aftermarket face cover that work very well. There is a slight adjustment to get used to with wearing glasses and using the headset but that will vary mostly on the size of your frames and personal comfort.I have had zero problems the functionality of the headset and controllers. Some games glitch a little but appear to be more server glitches when playing multiplayer on line games.I love this system!  It is versatile and operates very well and has a very good selection of games. I especially love that it is wireless ( unless you add headphones or a battery pack). I have headphones that really help the sound but have yet to add the battery pack but will probably do so very soon.I did recently try the PSVR headset and was not impressed after buying the Oculus.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Wow, just pure awesomeness","The system itself is amazing. Graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen for a VR and the system is really easy to use. The free games alone make this worth it. Got it for my 11 year old son and My wife and I cant wait to put the kids to bed so we can have a turn. You don't need the larger version, 64GB is plenty enough when most games aren't even 1 GB. The only con for this is the headset strap. They sell quest 2 straps on Amazon that are much better than what comes with it, but even with that, this is the best gaming system I have ever played."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best $300 I’ve spent,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I was a little apprehensive about buying an oculus quest 2 but I am very happy with it. This is the coolest thing I have bought. I recommend you buy one. It’s more fun than my 1,000 dollar pc build. My favorites games are echo vr (free), thrill of the fight ($10) and creed: rise to glory ($30). Most of the games are pretty cheap and there’s a lot of fun free games too. You can also use side quest to put more games that aren’t available in the oculus store. 1000% get one."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Fun,"Super fun, lightweight. Honestly I was a little put off by the internal tracking vs the lighthouse sensors that the Index has, I was mainly worried about how accurate tracking would be, and honestly it's been great so far. It works just as well as the Index or Vive, only issue I've had with tracking is that it loses some accuracy when it's really dark in the room, but that's not really worth complaining about to be honest. As far as quest link goes, I personally have had a really hard time with 3rd party branded USB-C cables, so I would look for higher quality more expensive ones and be careful about trying to go too cheap with them, a lot of the cheaper ones are branded to work great with the Quest 2, but they really don't. Other than that, it does work really well with Oculus Link, and there's basically no screen door effect at all."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Quest 2,"I have seen plenty of peple saying you need a Facebook account to use this. You do not Oculus was owned by Samsung initially and that is when the S7 came out they offered people the oculus and you had to out your phone into it to do VR. When that was done you had to set up an Oculus account to use it, my email is the same for the Oculus account and Fcebook. When I tried loggin in with my Facebook it gave me an error and said I already have an Oculus account. I used the same email for Facebook and Oculus so it would not allow me to log in with Facebook. This is only for people who did the buy one get one offer when the S7 came out 5 years ago. I am enjoying using it so far and have purchased some add on that were receommended by YouTubers who reviewed the product. If anyone is worrying about battery life it is a concern but if you are not playing something that you a flailing all over the place you can get a 16 or 25ft cord and be fine."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,If you are new to vr.... GET THIS!!!,"For perspective I am a 20year old college student.This is an amazing headset for getting into vr. I use it for casual gaming and school. My parents use it for cardio. The vibe you get is similar to when the Wii first came out and everyone went crazy for it. Except the Quest 2 is a lot more versatile. If you have a powerhouse of a pc you should consider something else. But other than that its perfect.I use the quest for social vr, games, cardio and school. Its really helpful with school because if im doing a hard reading or a really long one, I can just load into one of the home theatres and stream my reading to the big screen. For games the graphics could be better, but if you connect it to your pc you can get some really realistic stuff.THE AUDIO IS ALSO AMAZING. ITS SO IMMERSIVE.Must buy in my opinionTip: Go into developer mode and enable the higher refresh rate of 120hz. It'll make the homescreen feel way more real."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,VR for the masses!,"My wife LOVES her Oculus! She plays beat saber all the time. She had wanted a VR headset for years, but needing an expensive PC was a barrier. With this being $300 and stand alone, and the 2nd gen, we knew it would be a good starter VR buy.Yes, you need a FB account. They are (have already?) making it so you can have multiple users under one FB account and share the software, so that'll be nice when I can finally beat my wife's scores, lol.Battery life is 3hrs. It can be kind of a pain if you want to keep playing past that, but honestly, take the break while it recharges."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awesome VR experience... semi-reasonablely priced.,"I purchased this unit for my son for Christmas. If you're familiar with VR tech, you'll know right away that the Oculus Quest 2 is an incredible upgrade from it's predecessor. Newbies will be blown away. The former Oculus was great but it had some lag issues that caused game play to be choppy at best. The Quest 2 is smooth and very crisp in the graphics department. I get really bad motion sickness when playing some games and so far, even I've been able to enjoy the occasional run through zombies and gladiators. If you're looking for a semi-reasonablely priced, high quality VR experience...The Oculus Quest 2 is where it is."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oculus is so awesome!,"This is the perfect production of a vr system.I've had mine for almost 6 months now and have about 10 cool games of all types.It's so cool and works perfectly.Other have written this next line as well, but its so true.If you're thinking about purchasing an Oculus Quest 2, stop reading reviews and just purchase it.P. S. Buy your games on sale, they have daily deals, so I just make a wish list of the games I want to purchase, and then I check the daily deals and only but them on sale, I saved over $100 that way.Have fun, and maybe I'll see you in the game  : )"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,BEST EVER!,"Love this.  I use it for workouts and cardio.  Amazing.  I upgraded to the headband thing vs. the strap and added some more eye pads styles for comfort and to support my glasses better.  I also added wrist and ankle weights and my own ear pods that I'm used to.  All good, really enjoying.  I also let my 9 year old niece and 7 year nephew use it - it's the best ever.  I set them up with the guardian (boundary) and an activity app and they are entertained for hours.  They are engaged, thinking and not watching TV.  Mom approved."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,THIS IS AMAZING!!!,"This VR Headset is Amazing because it is not like those other VR Headsets where you have to put it in a good PC and if you don't have one you have to pay like $2000 dollars but for this VR you don't need to connect it to a PC you can just take it outta your box connect it to your controllers and your good although you do have to have a Facebook account but don't worry you can always just create one it is very easy and you have to download the Oculus app on your phone and boom your done you can start playing any game you want and the best part is you can take it anywhere anytime because it is a portable VR which is my favourite part about it since especially I travel a lot so I can take this anywhere anytime it is so Amazing!!! Not only that but you can also play so many great games like Vader Immortal which is my favourite game on the VR btw, You can play beatsaber and then you can also play online VR Chat and you get access to so many games FOR FREE and lemme tell you they are spectacular games There are over 1000 games and you can even make a game if you want so ya well thats it for the review there are a lot of other things I could talk about as well but these are just my favourite parts well if you want to purchase an Oculus Quest 2 and you don't know yet if you want to purchase it just if you see my review then go ahead purchase it because it is Amazing ok everyone have a great day bye!!!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,El futuro está aquí,"Cuando vi por primera vez la realidad virtual me decepcionó un poco, deje pasar unos cuantos años y volví a intentarlo con este Oculus Quest 2... Realmente he quedado asombrado lo mucho que ha avanzado la tecnología, es muy divertido y no me arrepiento de haber optado por eso en vez de otra consola... Esto es el futuro!.Compra realizada desde Chile, llegó con la caja un poco golpeada pero el producto no tenía daños.Tengo que agregar un comentario... a pesar de que no me arrepiento de la adquisición del producto.Empecé a tener irritación por el uso de este, pero no le di mayor importancia pensando que era tal vez por el roce de la espuma del visor, viendo por YouTube me enteré que había un problema de reacciones alérgicas al material de la espuma del visor. Me comuniqué con oculus a través del formulario que hay en su web para el cambio de esta espuma defectuosa, pero me responden que no hay cobertura para mi país a pesar de que si pueden enviar este producto... Me parece lamentable que no puedan hacerse cargo de un problema como este y que se laven las manos diciendo que no pueden responder, además de poco creíble que una empresa tan grande como Facebook no pueda enviar el cambio del producto defectuoso a Latinoamérica. En fin, a pesar de que mantengo mis halagos al producto, no puedo recomendar a gente de Latinoamérica u otro país sin cobertura que realice la compra hasta que no este solucionado este problema o hagan envío del recambio junto a la compra del visor de realidad virtual."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Satisfried with this product,I love this product works great. I wish it was compatible with most computers but till tech advances I have to say its great! Needs more games....needs more programmers. I love how its its own device you dont need anything extra really you just pop it on and instant escapism from a stressful world. Its been helping me with my depression. The light hower burns my retinas and may be causing brain damage so I have to take frequent breaks. I found a solution to that. I wear screen protective blue blocker glasses with it and Im okay now with the whole eye thing. Still working on the motion sickness ...thats more with the games than the actual product.  Thanks facebook for giving me a way to get back in shape and relieve mental anguish during the pandemic!
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This thing is frickin' AMAZING,"This is probably some of the best $300-400 that you can spend in my opinion. At first I was having a hell of a time trying to log in, but once I disabled multifactor authentication on Facebook I was able to log in on Quest and it has already given me hundreds of hours of fun. I've shown my parents and they've also loved it. Even if you don't want to spend money on games you can play thousands of games for free on VRChat for example. However I've bought several games and they are amazing. I HIGHLY recommend the Quest 2. It's also not just for gaming, I've used it to exercise, watch Netflix, and watch live events like SpaceX launches. If you're thinking of getting it, I say definitely do!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I'm now the coolest mom ever.,"Okay not really, I'm still a dork, but I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she LOVES it. She's not very  tech savvy but was able to set everything up easily with the help of a brief youtube tutorial. The VR experiences are phenomenal and she's happy to stay home every day and play with it.3-D art projects, world travel, flying through space, climbing mountains, dancing in nightclubs, solving mysteries, riding roller coasters... this is a fantastic solution for the pandemic lock down blues. I'm so impressed, I'm going to splurge on one for myself too."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Love our oculus,"Absolutely love our oculus. Our family cannot get enough of it. We can barely put it down long enough to just let it charge.I read a lot of reviews with people complaining that it is through facebook and they’re accounts getting deactivated for fraudulent? I rarely ever use my Facebook and it signed in no problem with no fraudulent detected. I guess if you’re against social media then don’t get it. But really all you have to do is sign in , there’s is nothing more it needs with your Facebook account. The oculus app on your phone is what helps run your device.They are just all around amazing, No matter what the age, everyone loves it"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,THE VR games console,"After nearly 3 years coping with psvr limitations in tracking, controls and content, finally got me the 64GB model with standard strap. It's simply awesome! Cable-free VR for fully moving and turning around, nearly perfect tracking, crystal clear display and a great selection of content - games, 3D movies, VR experiences of all kinds...I was worried while waiting for it to come, for so many people were hating the Facebook account requirement, or head strap being uncomfortable, built-in audio being lame, lcd display being all gray, limited IPD and all sorts of nitpicking by FB haters that honestly hold no water.The standard strap is comfortable enough. Adjusting to different head sizes in the family is easy enough and when currently set holds the headset in place fine no matter how sudden motions you do. My IPD is 71 and yet the max setting is pretty clear for me - any talk about blurriness is usual VR beginners unaware that borders of lenses are blurry - what matters is the central sweet spot which is quite large and clear. Only fresnel lenses glare is a common issue as usual, but they do tend to enhance the mood for high contrast scenes, like the sky against some building.Controls and tracking are way beyond anything on psvr, much happy here.Anyway, I don't have much to complain. This is a VR console in itself, too cheap to pass."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Legit next gen experience...,"Feels like we've hit a major tipping point in VR.The experience this device makes possible is interesting, almost dream like. If you are completely new to VR, I honestly feel this device has the potential to be paradigm shifting.Similar the way people see things differently after trying lsd or magic mushrooms...Funny but true.Obviously it's not the same experience, but the way it can potentially open ones imagination and challenge our perception of what's possible, the quest 2 experience for a VR virgin will have the edges of their reality redefined in-a-sense.The experience has a lucid dreaming like quality to it.It's hard NOT to dream up cool ideas and experiences for the technology after experiencing it yourself.As a product, the quest 2 has finally connected enough dots that not only show the real potential and direction of VR.It's the first legitimate QUALITY experience that is worth the time, money and effort for most people reading this review.For $299 you get movement tracking, room scale VR, with a good quality vibrant display, in a lightweight wireless headset.It's pretty astonishing how quickly Oculus has been able to iterate and develop the technology as well as it has.The the biggest negative seems to be the required integration with Facebook and the slippery slope that goes along with that...For some there is fear behind the Facebook integration because of data collection aspects. It's a valid concern, but I've long surrendered to the fact that almost everything we do digitally is collected by somebody at this point.The other big Facebook issue is related to accounts. Again, not a concern to me. I have a legit account, had it for years. I rarely post on it but I do check it.If you don't have a Facebook account and plan to create a new account just for the quest or you are going to try and work around having a legit Facebook account, it's prolly not worth that risk or hassle at this point in time.Back to the headset itself...Some users, especially those use to the quest 1 find the color black to not be as dark. This is a technological display related trade-off.The quest 2 gives up deep blacks for better colors, resolution and a reduction of the screen door effect.Imo I feel the trade-off is worth it. You get an overall much better display and it's 100 bucks cheaper.If you've never used a quest 1, are new to VR or you are coming from a different VR headset, you most likely won't care or notice the issue with the color black not being as black.Two more product related issue I want to mention. The headstrap and ipd settings...After reading reviews before getting the headset I ordered an elite strap with battery.After using the the headset with the standard strap, I think it's pretty good out the box and that the elite strap is not nearly as necessary as some reviewers made it out to be.As for the ipd issue. Again, not as big of an issue as some make it out to be. You can actually set the ipd in between the 3 settings giving much more wiggle room.Also if you happen to be someone who needs to use the widest ipd setting, using the included glasses spacer can further help improve the fov.One accessory I do recommend is the vr cover (not the fit kit) to replace the stock foam that presses against your face. It's noticably more comfortable and helps with light leakage. It's also easier to wipe down and clean if you sweat or have to share the headset with others.With that being said...Yes the quest 2 isn't perfect, but given the product and experience you get for the asking price, it's easily worth the cost of entry."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Unreal-Real science -fiction.,"This product is plug and play. Remember, looking at virtual reality demo or game play, does not do this justice. Once the helmet goes on, they reality is altered and you are no longer in this world. You are in your own, virtual world, and it’s almost impossible to relate to reality.Again, to emphasize this, no one can possibly explain how real virtual reality feels. I could not have believed it, unless I felt it. Remember, 3D is not virtual reality. 3D is the way you seethings in 3 dimensions, but virtual reality actually fools/ tricks your brain and other senses into accepting what is in fro t of you, as the reality. It is really not possible to explain, unless you feel it.I am no stranger to high tech gizmos, but allI can say is “Un-real  and unexplainable, could never truly understand, unless you are immersed in it.”  I would have never believed this was a possibility, but this science fiction is very realindeed. Thanks Oculus."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Wow, just wow!!!","Omgosh! All I can say is wow! Our son bought my husband one for his birthday and we are hooked. We ended up buying one for our nephew for graduation and it was a huge hit. Unreal! I love the exercise  program and my husband kills zombies, rides roller coasters, and kick boxes every day. Lol. Virtual reality is amazing!!! I exercise in different countries with trainers and absolute amazing scenery. It’s like you aren’t even working out. If you want to step away from life this is sure to help. Wow!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great VR option but not multi user friendly,It's a great design and fits well. I hate the fact they force you to use a Facebook about to use this device. Despite this negative my boys use it often since we set it up with my wife's Facebook account. I wish they would make their own line of accessories like a charging dock and extra power supply and external headphone options. The only way to use bluetooth headphones or ear buds with this is to pair it with your phone which makes it not as multi user friendly as it should be for families that have kids that want to share it.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This is the device of 2021. Its just amazing!,I purchased one for myself and my wife got me one for Xmas. Before the holiday I told her I got one but she kept the one she got. We have two units and they are just fantastic. They take the edge off of all the pandemic isolation and are supported by a plethora of apps of all sorts. That really surprised me. The games are great for fitness and mind  exercise. We play ping pong together and it is very REAL. I get at least 45minutes a day of exercise with this device alone. Plus the stationary immersed videos are great too. Worth every penny.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I love this,"I need to force myself to use this thing more. I have already gotten a huge library of VR games for PC, and then discover I can use a USB C cable to tether this together. A specially ordered cable later and yay. No I didn't buy the 80 dollar one off Facebook either. A simple 3rd party 30 dollar cable will work as long as it says 'active' in the description.I've looked for accessories and they are really few and far between because it almost doesn't need any enhancements. A solid improvement from their previous models all across the board."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,great headset,"The oculus quest 2 is a great overall headset.  I would recommend the elite strap as the stock one is not that comfortable,  but at 299.00.  I purchased the elite strap and still paid less than I did for the quest 1.  the resolution and refresh rate of the quest 2 make a huge difference and the upgraded processing power makes for a lot nicer visuals in game.  finally the tracking of the quest 2 is a major upgrade from the quest 1 my beat saber scores all improved since purchasing the quest 2.  In conclusion the headset is well worth the price so if you decide to take the plunge enjoy."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Quest 2 gud, Zuc bad","I own an original Quest, HTC Vive and a Valve Index. To whoever has this headset as their first VR headset, I'M JEALOUS. I might be a VR enthusiast and I was stoked when the new Oculus headset leaks were happening; however, i did not expect such an amazing upgrade for this great of a price! Battery life is around 2 hours, give or take depending on consistent gameplay.Pros:  -improved resolution  -amazing XR2 processing chip  -better tracking  -better controller battery lifeCons:  -headstrap is not that great (for $50 you  can get an upgrade)  -battery life is less than the older  generation quest  -mandatory Facebook login requirement  -only 3 IPD adjustment levelsOverall as a standalone VR headset this headset is a beast. The limited battery life can be upgraded with the upgraded elite headstrap with an extended battery built in, or you can buy a battery pack and use it whenever the headset battery runs out. My biggest issue is the required Facebook login, while it does not effect me ATM, knowing all i know, it is VERY possible that will change. However, Oculus did warn about the Facebook login, so if that is a turn off, do not buy, otherwise, this headset is a steal."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I like it,"I have only used it a few times since I got it in January 2020. I like it.  I use it primarily for the exercise program. I did get space pirate program that reminds me of the old space invaders - lots of fun. I like the 3D room it creates I would like it if I could ""lay on the couch"" in the room and read my own book.I wish they had a package like my wii has that includes different sports (bowling, running, flying an airplane, tennis etc) it seems some of these sports are available but you have to buy them individually."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I LOVE my Quest 2,"My husband prefers his Quest 1 since his IPD (Inter Pupil DIstance) is wider than the Quest 2's three settings, but for me it is perfect.  The picture is clearer, the batteries in the hand controllers last MUCH longer than in the Quest 1, & the stock head strap works just fine for me.  I plug my ear-buds into the jack on the Quest 2 and I am all set."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great entry product to the world of VR,"At this price and with the ability to play games and ""socialize"" in the virtual world, I may say this is the best product for the job. While others don't allow you to play without connecting (wired or wireless) to a computer or a game console, this VR set hosts a large directory of games and virtual rooms/worlds in it's 64GB memory without the need to upgrade. The whole family is excited and enjoy hours of fun with this device. I already purchase 3 of them - 2 for friends and one for my daughter."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Huge Mom-points for this buy!,"My 10 year old son cried when he opened this on his birthday.  He LOVES this thing!  I bought the carrying case to go with it and he takes it with him to his cousin's house, his dad's house, friends' houses.  I like it because there is only one cord, and its like a cell phone charging cord.  Easy-peasy.  It does not have to be hooked up to anything else, its a stand-alone device which is awesome.  The graphics are top-notch as well."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,AWESOME PRODUCT!,"For those of you reading this review wondering if you should buy the Oculus Quest 2, JUST DO IT! Honestly one of the best things I've bought ever!For those of you complaining that it's not a true ""Stand-alone Console"", you're pretty wrong. Yes, you have to download the Companion App to set it up, but from there, it's pretty much all in the headset itself!And finally, for those of you giving it 1-star reviews... grow up! Most of those reviews are towards things like app-sharing because of Facebook. Honestly, I don't believe in it too much!Overall: 5 out of 5 stars! A must-have for any gamer and/or tech savvy person!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best decision after I returned my Macbook!,"I did not know about the existence of such a product until 1 month ago and thanks to a friend of mine, I became aware of its existence. I bought M1 MB Air for about 1100 dollars, and after being informed about this product, I returned the computer and immediately bought Quest 2. I was able to return the mac because I already had a Windows laptop which was fine for me to use for the daily things.The last time I played table tennis was 5 years ago and because of the pandemic, I could not play even if I wanted to. But thanks to this device, I can now both exercise and go wherever I want! The battery lasts about 1 hour on average because I activated the 120hz mode and I think you should activate this mode, too. It won't make a big difference, but it sure does make a difference. Since I activate this mode, I also use PowerBank with Quest, because the screen has to work 33% faster than 90hz and therefore the battery runs out quickly. This is not a problem for people like me who won't mind using PowerBank. I don't want to comment on things on Facebook because I don't care what they follow and track, or not.To summarize; I think it's the best $ 300 you can spend, but definitely buy a different headband with it. I do not recommend EliteStrap. If you look at the comments, you will understand why. I can't wait for the Oculus Quest 3!An update after 2 weeks of use: All of a sudden, a dead pixel occured on the right bottom of the left screen. Amazon accepted to replace the headset. Thanks to Amazon but... Sad experience."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,What a solid VR experience.,"This is great. I bought it to upgrade from my PSVR. Wow there is no comparison. The fact that I can draw any shape in a room and play in it is nuts. Also using virtual desktop means that you can play almost any game available for VR wirelessly. I thought I’d be using this mostly connected to my pc, but I have used it wirelessly 90% of the time. Only downside is it only has two hours of battery life. That’s okay though because of the elite strap with battery pack will fix that. Also the original straps for the headset are crap. Not comfortable and I would highly suggest ordering the elite strap at the same time of purchasing your Quest 2. This to me is the best way to play games in VR. Come join the community! 😁"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazing,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and husband.  I watched about 20 youtube videos before doing it.  I expected my husband who is techie to love it, and my son to love it once he used it.  To my surprise, it was the opposite.  My son was sooooo excited, and my husband was like ""Meh.""  After playing it, they both loved it.  I finally got to try it after my son went to sleep one night.  I am not at all techie.  And I loved it too.  Definitely fun if you have the $$ to spend on a toy.  I wanted it for the museums I have heard you can tour on it.  Maybe one day I will get to try it for that.  There is plenty to do on it without spending more money for apps, but the apps are tempting.  Plenty of great youtube tips on it, playing with it, using it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"You people, so ignorant...","Best VR headset on the market... value wise. I would honestly suggest this headset over an index as long as you have a good pc. The main reason people don't want to buy this headset is beyond idiotic, ""I have to link my Facebook account, if I do that they will steal all my DATA!!!!"" Um, you do know that Amazon does that, Instagram does that, your internet provider does that and anything else you've ever subscribed to or signed up for. If you don't like FB stealing data why would you let all of these other companies?!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A must have with a few upgrades.,"If you are planning on getting into VR this is the one you want to get. It's an all in one system that doesn't need a computer and will run just fine on it's own. The only things you need to get are a head strap and a face plate. Everything else optional, I am trying to talk my wife into getting one for herself as a birthday gift to me. So we can both watch movies and play games together. This is something kids will enjoy, and it can be a good work out for those who pick the right games. 9.5/10"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Exciting experiences, some flaws","I really enjoy this headset. For any starters, I'd recommend buying 64 GB. If you already have some knowledge on VR, then maybe choose 256 GB. Anyways, I was having a blast playing games like ""Bait!"".  Now of course, if you were expecting a library with tons of free games, your wrong. Most games cost money to play, and it's very annoying with the free selections. I also wanted to point out that Roblox VR is only available for Virtual Desktop. Basically, it's another $20 fee you have to pay. If you only wanted to purchase this headset (like me), then try one with a cable. If your looking to spend, then sure, it's fun!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awesome Product!,"I recently bought the Quest 2 to compare it with the Rift-S that I bought a week earlier. Needless to say, the Oculus Quest 2, in my honest opinion, is better. I thought that wireless play wouldn't be that big of a deal, however, when hooked up with Virtual Desktop to my computer, I realized that the latency was extremely minimal. I was able to freely move without feeling the weight of the wires on my head, which was a huge game-changer. I didn't notice any screen quality changes from the Rift-S to Quest 2. On the other hand, the only down side about the Quest 2 is the uncomfortable strap. The Rift-S had a superior strap that was fitted for longer game sessions, while I would constantly feel the weight of the Quest 2 that pulled my face down. I ordered another strap, which fixed the problem. Would highly recommend this product, especially as a gift."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Super fun. You'll get lost in the Oasis.,"Really, I haven't had much of a chance to use these because my husband hogs them. HE seems to be having a lot of fun. Ok, I did play Elvin Assassin, which was fun, if not a little repetitive. And I rocked at mini-golf. Got a few pars and one birdie. Mostly double bogies though. I tried the one where you're on a space ship, and that was very dizzying--and I can handle those dizzy rides at Epcot. I just couldn't get the hang of it. So, overall, super cool and very user friendly for those of us new to VR. The head set is a little heavy, but honestly, I only noticed when I first put it on and once I took it off. While playing, I totally forgot. Oh, and also, I wear glasses and they fit over my glasses. Yay. Super fun! I'll have to try an exercise app next."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best VR system for its value and capablilities,"The Quest 2 can be used, as a stand alone VR system.  However, it truly shines once paired with a gaming PC expanding its library of games.  Once updated to v28, the Quest 2 can use Air Link to wirelessly connect to a PC.  Good bye tethered VR cable.  I've played Digital Combat Simulator and Star Wars Squadrons on Air Link and it was like using an Oculus Link cable without the cable.  Resolution is better than a Vive Index or Rift S.Truly an outstanding piece of hardware starting at three hundred dollars."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best purchase I think I've ever made.,This is one of the best purchases I've ever made in my life. We play on it almost nightly and we use it so much that we almost always end up staying on it for hours at a time. I've bough multiple accessories for it and it's so great. Not just playing games and being active on it is fun. I also watch YouTube and movies on it as well as surf the web sometimes. You can do lots of things other than just play games and if you're looking for some cool tech I'd definitely say get this thing!
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,OMG!!! This is the BEST thing under the sun.,"I was a proud owner of a first Gen Quest VR headset until Facebook announced the Quest2. I was skeptical at first about upgrading. After all the tempting video reviews i decided to bite the bullet and upgrade and OH BOY!!! THIS HEADSET ROCKS!!!! My biggest pet peeve with the first gen Quest was the Screen door effect and with this headset, the SDE is almost non-existent. The 90Hz refresh rate makes the VR experience Mind-Blowing.  The expanded storage on the Quest2 means I don's need to uninstall games to install new ones. Overall this headset is totally worth every cent!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Effing Brilliant Device,"It's amazing how far VR has come in 4 years.  I'm coming off of a CV1 Rift and the difference, everything from the resolution to SDE to ease of use, is starkely, remarkably better. And the fact that you can easily use this fully self-contained VR system with a high-powered PC either cabled or wireless is just amazing.  Gone are the days of setting up external sensors, or even the need for PCs for that matter!  And for $300!  If you're at all interested in VR (you should be, it's next-level) GET ONE OF THESE."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Owned original Quest and purchased Quest 2; Great choice.,I can repeat all that is said before this but here goes: My games are transferable to the newer model. The visual quality is great except the blacks are a little muddy. Smaller and lighter than the previous model. Less battery life. Priced lower and more affordable. I had to exchange a faulty set but Amazon did a quick return so no complaints there.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It was a present to my sister and she loves it.,Sister loves it.she says it's better than she expected it to be. The experience is not like your cheap vr head set. I tried the cheap holder where you insert your phone those are garbage this is a whole new level.im glad I tried it. Also a great work out tool and helps with hand eye coordination. After letting people try my oculus to play beatsaber I realized that most people have really bad coordination kids and adults this will help you move and even teach you to dance more fluidly.
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Rolling the dice?,"To date, I have purchased 3 Quest 2 headsets. One for my Wife, My Granddaughter, and myself. The quest 2 my wife has, performs flawlessly. My Granddaughter has no problems to date either. My headset however is another story. The first one overheated and became so hot on my face, it was alarming. I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. They had the replacement here before I even finished boxing up the bad headset! The second one ran flawlessly for about 6 weeks. It developed tracking problems to the point the headset would lock up and it started to overheat then. Sent it back to Amazon, got a refund. Amazon is great, Etu ,Oculus ? you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting a good one from my experience. And Oculus support is a joke.  You spends your money and you takes your chances."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great headset for the money.,"ProsEasy to setupWirelessComes already chargedController batteries last a dang long timeSurprisingly comfortable, especially coming from a quest 1.Snappy, fast, simpleWorks with glassesEasy to control with the appConsAfter playing for a while the front heavy device feels off and uncomfortable"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Unbelievable Hardware for the Price but What's the Cost?,"The hardware alone is worth the price, but keep in mind that you're buying a headset from Facebook, an advertising company. The reason they can offer such a great headset at a low price is because they can subsidize it with the ad money after sale.It's a great headset, for a great price, with a very well thought out user experience. I would recommend this to anybody. With the ability to choose between PCVR and using the Oculus natively you can't go wrong. Just keep in mind that you will be advertised to and you will need a Facebook account. The more expensive headsets are more expensive because they don't have ads to sell you on the back end."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,FB sucks but everything else is perfect,"While yes, screw Facebook in addition to the account requirement which is a concerning choice but not surprising. However, the FB requirement is the only thing I have against this headset. It is an amazing headset with an affordable price. I don't usually leave reviews but this is one of the best purchases I have made. I like that you have the option to play wirelessly or harness your PC's power. The battery life leaves something to desired but it is easily mitigated by the option battery strap or playing via Oculus Link. Highly recommend this for anyone interested in trying out VR"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Extremely Fun! Limited Games,"Very enjoyable product, I find myself wanting to play all the time when I have the energy.The only two gripes I have are the games and the battery life. Both are obviously technology issues and are understandable. If you want to play every game available in VR, then I would recommend getting a headset tailored towards your PC.I don’t have a PC, so I went with the Quest 2. I love it! I like having an active experience, so games like Superhot and Vader Immortal are a must.The battery life is also rough (about 2 hours of play time). I have a lot of energy, but there have only been a handful of times where I had to stop due to the battery.Super fun for those active, and want to dip their toes in VR!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,🤩 Rockstar VR System at a Amazing Value,"This headset is absolutely amazing!  Coming from PlayStation 4 VR this system set a new standard for VR experiences at an amazing price point.  Sure you have to have a Facebook account, but you need to have a PlayStation or a Microsoft account using Hololens.  I don’t think this unreasonable to access the experiences these platforms are providing.  It your concerned about your privacy, don’t get on the internet.  Your information, and usability is how these platforms make the experiences better for the users.If your looking for a way to get an awesome system to get you a mind blowing experience for amazing price, this is the system for you.  Add a pair of wired headphones to go deeper into you experience and be careful because it is easy to get lost in the virtual environments through the worlds you explore."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,The best VR ever !,"We have purchased 3 sets of these. And plan to actually try and get one more .Our family loves this .You can play games,watch movies, communicate with others and so much more.The videos are cruel and clean and does not lag the current internet . You do not need a computer or device to play the games either .The only downfall I feel is it is inside only . If there was a way to make it outdoors safely I think it would be the most perfect game console ever !"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Parents, and facebook worry DO NOT FEAR",I just want to say for anyone reading reviews yes you have to have a Facebook account for it. But thats all like you dont need to use facebook and when you are in oculus you dont have facebook in your face or anything its just a log in thats it. If you used oculus before facebook already has the information from your account it wont affect you anyway you dont have to use facebook i dont even use facebook but i have this vr. If you are worried about putting your children in a social media risk do not fear just make a account sign it in and youll never touch facebook again never see or hear from it ever as long as you keep it signed in
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,DONT LISTEN TO THE COMPLAINTS,"Don't listen to the people saying you'll get locked out, you won't. As long as you use your real fb account you're fine. I've had my headset since launch and not had any problems. I've never heard of anyone near me having problems either, and I've talked to a lot of owners of the q2. The chance you'll get locked out is low, only only if you go against their ToS/use a fake(alt) accountThe Quest 2 is great, especially for the price. The screen door effect is nearly non-existent and it has many games to play. It's been relatively comfortable to me so that's good. I have yet to use it as a PC VR headset so I have no review on that. There is one problem however, and that is the low battery life. This can be fixed by getting the elite strap with a battery pack. Overall, it's a great headset. There has never been a better time to jump into VR"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Quite The Upgrade From The CV1,I bought this headset after unsuccessfully attempting to buy a 3060 ti for about a month and I don't regret settling for this one bit.Pros (compared to the CV1):WirelessCan go anywhereHigher resolution lensesInside-out tracking (no external trackers needed)90hz-120hz displays (120hz is only accessible through sidequest it seems)Doesn't require a PCIncludes a spacer so that you can more easily wear glasses while in VRCons:Sub-par default head strapSpeakers have terrible audio bleeding that causes everyone around you to hear everythingThings are blurry at the edges of your viewForced to have a Facebook accountForced to have a tablet/phone compatible with the oculus app (nearly caused me to have to return the headset)Uncomfortable after long periods of playingGets really sweaty after playing over half an hour (even if I am not physically doing much in VR)
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Holy Crap!  This is so real!,"I am in love!! Thats all i can say!  This thing is awesome!! Im 65 years old and i feel like a kid again!  I haven’t ridden a rollercoaster since i was a teenager, now i get to do it every day if i want to, It is so surreal!  As close to the real thing as you can get.  I can watch all my shows  on a huge screen now .... why would anyone pay to go to a movie theater ever again.  If you are thinking about getting one of these, just do it!  You’ll either love it or hate it!"
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Great way to get into VR,"I have wanted this since before Christmas. I have always been interested in BR, but it always seemed to pricey at the time. The Oculus Quest 2 came right on time. My computer isn't that great so I am glad it's stand alone. It's sound quality without headphones surprised me. It sounds really good, I just didn't realize everyone else can hear what you are watching really good too. The games I found and the apps you can get for free are amazing if you learn how to use sidequest you could also download things not in the official app store. When you put the headset on you really feel like you are where ever you booted up. But be careful, the motion. Sickness is real. For me it strikes when the image is in motion, but I know I'm not moving. But all and all I love this purchase."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Amazing headset for an amazing price, just don’t scratch the lenses","The oculus quest 2 is a really nice headset for the price, really good specs, Qualcomm snapdragon XR2 processor and 6gb of ram with 64gig storage is amazing for the price. They had to cut corners somewhere like at the head strap and the ipd adjuster which is a major flaw, but as long as you fit into the correct ipd selections they give you and you can use the head strap(you can buy a pro strap which is really nice). This headset is hard to pass up when getting into VR or have a low budget, having to sign into Facebook was no big deal I already linked my oculus and FB accounts, but for people beware of the lenses scratching and buy some protectors first. All being said this headset is amazing and I love using it."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Best Fitness Accessory Ever,"I got this for playing games, and ended up getting more exercise than I ever have in my life- and I hate structured exercise programs.From Supernatural to Beat Saber to boxing games, you'll get a good amount of cardio in every day without even thinking about it, and without leaving your house. It's a great addition to dietary changes for weight loss. As somebody who suffered from chronic poison and fatigue, it's been life changing."
5.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Onece they get a good headstrap it will be the best product ive used in a very long time!!,"I got it as a first VR experience gaming toy. It does Sooooo much more!!! I havnt been overall satisfied with any product before like i was with this. It has endless  future possibilities. Now i know why FB and Zuckerberg were talking it up so much. The $300-$400 price tag is well worth it. The 1 big drawback i have with this and other VR headsets is the strap. Since it is still somewhat heavy, the 3 point headstrap does very little for comfort. The front of mine keeps falling onto my nose and around my  head which keeps changing the vision. Then the comfort strap costs $50. Other than that, it is an awesome product. Well worth the price for what you get!!"
