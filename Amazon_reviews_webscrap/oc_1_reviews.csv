1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,FACEBOOK CAN JUST DISABLE YOUR FB ACCOUNT AND MAKE YOUR QUEST 2 USELESS!!!,"I've been looking forward to this VR headset since they announced it. I pre-ordered it as soon as possible, and I didn't even care if you had to log in with facebook. I didn't have a facebook account, so I made one about a week before I was getting my quest 2 in my excitement as October 13th grew closer. October 13th comes, I get my headset, I try to log in to use my quest 2 and start buying games right away, and I was stopped in my tracks to find that facebook just disabled my profile the same day. Why? I would also like to know. I filled out the appeal they asked for, sent them a picture of my driver's license (which is super messed up btw) and I have no idea what so ever when I'm gonna be able to use my headset. It's a $300 paper weight sitting on my desk. If facebook's algorithm decides to disable your account, your quest 2 will completely useless, you've been warned..."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,replace all the words Oculus with Facebook to be an accurate description,its a FACEBOOK NOT OCULUS product you HAVE TO HAVE IT SIGNED INTO FACEBOOK TO USE IT
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook wants your info,"I guess I should have realized that being controlled by Facebook means I have to register and then allow access to my phone's info to Facebook. I quit facebook a while ago, and I have no wish to go back and even less to give them access to any information on my phone. I was looking forward to the product and am sending it back tomorrow."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"NOT ""All-In-One"" - PHONE REQUIRED!","""Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset"" - HAHA! Lies right off the bat requiring you to pair your phone (and its associated data) to this device, so that it captures virtually everything you do to a Facebook account.Even if you have a burner FB account and phone ready for this, they'll still be able to associate your real Facebook account, as well as those of your roommates' and/or family, via the wi-fi network you log in with."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,NO to exposing my kid to Facebook and social media nightmares!,"Got this for my 13 year old as BD gift, just to learn it requires a Facebook account. Exposing my kid to social media jungle! HELL NO.  Returning this garbage back just because of this. Will never buy this brand again in a million years with these odd requirements. This is the last thing my family needs!Oculus and Zuckerberg can kiss my business goodbye!!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Banned for life for being targeted by hate group. Lost all my games.,"My Facebook account was disabled a few years ago when my profile picture caught the attention of an alt-right facebook group. After repeated death threats being sent to me (which facebook ignored) my account was disabled and facebook asked me to send them a picture of my photo ID to prove who I was. Apparently one of the tactics people use if they are targeting you is having a large group of people report your account to facebook and trigger a bot to disable your account. I sent my ID to them and they never fixed it, so I gave up and stopped using Facebook. Now my account is banned and I was told it can't be renewed. If I try and make a new account they ban that one too. This means I can't use this product I ordered and all my games that I linked to a new account from my quest 1 are gone too. Hundreds of dollars worth of games. Don't trust facebook and don't buy this."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,5 star product 1 star experience,This is a fantastic product but Facebook forcing me to participate in their social network to use a VR product makes a 5 star product a 1 star experience.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Facebook can ban you for any reason, and this becomes a paperweight.","I didn't think it was a big deal to require facebook to use this, but I didn't think they'd prevent accounts that are banned from even using it.  My account happens to be in good standing, but there are many, many reports of others getting their accounts banned due to looking like a fake account to the algorithm.  Rather than having fun with this, I fear every minute I'll get banned too."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Returning this 300 dollar paperweight.... thank you facebook.,"I eventually  convince myself to take the plunge and sign up for facebook after 5 years when I deleted my account. I entered all my reall information, name, date of birth, email etc.  I verified my account using my real phone number. After I linked my Oculus account to Facebook within 10 minutes I noticed my Facebook account was disabled because I didnt follow Community Standards. They requested a selfie video wich I gladly provided them with using their app. After waiting 24 hours, when I try to log on I get a message  We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed"". Now I cannot use my new Oculus Quest 2. I encourgae everyone thinking of buying one, to think twice. Even you succeed at linking your FB to your device, later on in the future you can easily be banned and also be an owner or a $300 Brick."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazon removed my 1-star review!,"Had a much deserved 1-star review of the Quest 2 due to the inability of getting Oculus/FB customer support to fix the Facebook ""merge"" operation they conducted when registering the device.  Funny thing was, it appears that someone out there doesn't like those bad reviews and reported it as a violating of ""Amazon Review Standards"".Say what?  I gave a legitimate review.  Anyway, here's another richly deserved 1-start for the Quest 2.  Fact is, Facebook (who own Oculus) have badly mismanaged the rollout of this product.  It's sad, really, because it could have been a great device given the specs.  The registration and TOA for this product need to be redone before I would advise anyone to buy it.  Also, I would be careful with the purchase of all Oculus devices until the clean up their poor customer support operations."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook account,You can't use it unless you have Facebook account and you are signed in on the system. If you are not a fan of Facebook you might want to stay away.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awesome product... works great. Facebook running the whole thing is not.,"I love the product. Even though Facebook owns Oculus, the fact you have to link your FB and Oculus accounts together, and you have to use your phone, is horrible. I have a buddy who wanted to play the same game on his Rift while I use the Quest 2. He had to actually make a Facebook account, download the app to his phone, the connect his new Facebook account to his Oculus account, and now logs into Oculus with his Facebook account.That is a horrible business model for a gaming device. How in the hell do you expect the general public to play a gaming system that you have to jump through hoops just to play?Perfect gaming system, horrible PR and marketing."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Two oculus = no multiplayer,"MUST READ!!1-you cannot play multiplayer on the oculus if you have two oculus under one Facebook account, they want you to purchase the game separately to play. To take more money from the user2-once an account is linked to the oculus, guess what it’s like marriages, it’s linked forever3-If you have two oculus under the same account you cannot play multiplayer.4- to play multiplayer the both people must on their own oculus.5- Facebook is taking your data and selling it! We have to stop them"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook can and will prevent you from making an account which makes the quest unusable,I tried creating a Facebook account with my legal information and for no reason they decided to disable my account. My quest 2 is now useless for me now and in the future thanks to Facebook's restrictions. Do not trust this company and do not buy this product.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oculus + Facebook = Disaster,"I have a previous Oculus account and try to merge it with my facebook account and it wont merge so I reach out to support.  I am told it will take 72-96 hours to fix the software issue. Many people can go to the hospital, have a baby, and get back before this is scheduled to be fixed. JC died, was buried and rose again before this will be fixed. Pitiful Oculusedit: 5 days later still waiting. no feedback from oculus.  awful support!!!  They could really learn from Amazon how to give support!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"This thing and facebook  is tracking, and spying on your underage children!!","Just the thought of this thing tracking my teen daughter gives me the creeps! You need to send in your ID for verification, YOUR STATE ID, OR DRIVERS LICENSE!You want headaches all day then get this thing, seriously tracking your every view and movement is insanely like 1984! Absolutly no way! We have grown to be too complacent with having no privacy but I think this is the next lever of surrender of privacy! Forget the bells and whistles stay far, far away!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,You are REQUIRED to have a Facebook account to use this. Previous versions owners are being forced!,"You fork out $400 to get this product just to end up seeing in the setup that you are REQUIRED to have a Facebook profile and to be logged in at all times in order to use this $400 product you just purchased.Owners of the previous oculus were apparently notified that they will be required to abide by the same rules in 2 years. So basically, the company is saying, ""Thank you for your money, but this is still not really a product that YOU own"". Nobody sees this as a high level scam? Is it because they are a well known company? It might be legal, but it doesn't make it morally right or fair to the customer at all.With all of the data collection issues Facebook has been exposed for, I see it this way. You are paying $400 dollars to be forced to use their social media platform in order for them to collect and possibly sell more of your personal data.You are limited to the games they have unless you buy an $80 cord to hook to your pc to play more."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Terrible customer service and unusable piece of equipment,Same complaint as everybody else. I didn’t want to create a Facebook account but what the hell! So I merged it with my oculus account and I’m banned immediately. I have had this thing since the day of release and have not been able to use it. Have received no response from oculus on what to do. I’ve bought every piece of oculus hardware but this is it for me.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook is frustrating,"Oculus is a great company and they make great products, but when Facebook is in charge the experience makes it so much worse. Most people are enjoying their Quest 2 right now, because they have a working Facebook account. I know that many other people have this problem, creating a new account for the new device, merging their Oculus and Facebook account together, or anything in between. I received this product 3 days before writing this review, and in those 3 days have had to wrestle with Facebook to try and make a legit account. I've had to make 4 accounts and they all got disabled. In my knowledge I did not bend or break the community standards in any of those accounts. I am now returning this product in hope that there will be competitors against Oculus/Facebook very soon. I am also hoping that Facebook can listen to the community and help users to actually have fun, instead of shutting people down. I am frustrated and disappointed, buyers beware and be careful. (This was the first vr headset I did own)"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blackscreen of death,"Can't say much about the headset. I tried to update the software, as instructed, and that was enough to break the headset. Here's to hoping their support will be able to solve the issue or else I'll just get a refund from Amazon.EDIT: Oculus couldn't figure out the issue but thankfully Amazon refunded me without issue."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Horrible experience,"An out of box experience from 20 years ago.  Horrible manual process to type information.  To create a Facebook account to even use the device, you have to jump through a ton of hoops.  To use steam vr games (the games on the oculus store are a joke) you need to either run a cable or do remote desktop vr.  Do not buy this garbage."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Disappointed,"I tested a friend's Oculus Rift and thought it was the best thing ever. The image quality was very clear and was amazed by the overall performance.I looked on Amazon and noticed the newest version of Oculus was being released and decided to make the big purchase of Oculus Quest 2.It has been a great disappointment. The text comes in crystal clear, but everything else is blurry. I become slightly dizzy and have to stop after 10 minutes.I’ve read many trouble shooting blogs regarding this common problem and nothing works. I am learning more from various online reviews that this is a persistent problem with this specific model.I would recommend buying a different model that has a proven track record. Now I have a very expensive paper weight."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook has ruined the Oculus experience.,"The hardware is OK, and the technology has come along way, but Facebook has ruined the experience. Facebook now requires association with a single Facebook account per device. Forget sharing the device amongst family members.And to make matters worse, once a Facebook account is associated with a device, it is fused for the life of the device. Even a factory reset does not break the association. Facebook has done everything to assure use of their social platform and drive a device per person story over the experience of their customers.I don’t mind the availability of a social aspect of the Oculus, but Facebook is forcing it. I should not have to take additional steps to avoid social interaction if I simply want to use the device to play a game or enjoy an experience.  Also, why would I want Facebook tracking my every move on a game device."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Very blurry and bad battery life,None of the IPD settings worked for me and if you wear glasses they might not work well either without having to shell out more money for the Oculus Quest 2 Fit Pack
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,5/5 headset. 1/5 Facebook,5/5 on the headset! 1/5 for Facebook login required! 1/5 for Facebook BRICKING headsets because of how the CUSTOMER wants to use their device!
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,THIS VR HEADSET MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As soon as you unbox your oculus quest 2 , you have no optional way of disabling the Facebook feature and how they use your DATA , You need a Facebook account and if you attempt to create a NEW FACEBOOK ACCOUNT,  Facebook will automatically brick your oculus , and bann you from Facebook.  HOW DO I know this , cuz it happened to my friends and many other people.  If u dont mind taking a risk and having your DATA stored somewhere you dont want it to and this goes for everything you do in the oculus quest 2 then THIS HEADSET IS NOT FOR YOU!!!!!! there are many other options available,  I ended up returning mine and getting the HP REVERB V2 , it is much better and competes with other premium quality VR HEADSETS. So if you have not pre-ordered this headset really think hard whether you want to take that risk. People can also report you in games which will end in your account being banned and your headset being useless again so think wisely.(SHORT SUMMARY OF IT: FACEBOOK CAN BANN YOUR OCULUS ACCOUNT MAKING YOUR PURCHASES WORTH 0)"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Requires you to send them your Driver's License if you don't have an existing Facebook account,"I cannot complete setup of the unit because it is asking for a Facebook account. I have an Oculus account but do not have a Facebook account. Upon signing up for a new facebook account they want a copy of my ID. No thank you. After researching this it seems all your activity on your Oculus is shared by default and you have to specifically turn it off. Furthermore, if your Facebook account is deactivated for your own privacy or safety reasons (like domestic violence) you will lose all your Oculus purchases. This is just insane. Will be sending this back. Sorry Amazon, this isn't your fault but I'm not keeping a device which I cannot use without letting facebook 3D-map the inside of my house."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook... Destroyer of Holiday Joy,"I thought people were being overly dramatic about the whole Facebook account thing and being deactivated. Nope. It really wasn’t that impressive when it was working but now they’re useless conversation pieces sitting on our end table.  We thought we’d give it to the kids at the beginning fo the holidays to try and cheer up a really bad 2020. I bought two! Not worth it. Why Facebook would lock out an account I have no idea. And now I can’t even complain on facebook or use facebook messenger to talk to our family in other parts of the world.  Be gone with Happiness. Save your kids the misery and just give them a large lump of coal or go get a rock from outside and set on your table and just tell everyone its the new Occulus system. That way your kids wont get all excited then have their hopes dashed, they’re just disappointed from the start.  I’m also out the money from the games i bought.  Such a joke.  Too bad it wasn’t owned by amazon.  Consider yourselves warned.  Don’t ruin your holidays like we did.  I suppose if you’d like you could always give it as the perfect end to 2020 to sum up what a awful year it has been and truly end the year on a massively disappointing Christmas note!  I find the irony hilarious for some reason even though I’m totally out a boatload of money."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Tech is getting there,"It's still primitive IMO, but we're going in the right direction. I think this is one of the best products for VR but it's still not good enough. It's still a gimmick. I'm returning mine soon.AND now for the Facebook part... seriously this is one of the biggest things I HATE about this product. You have to tie it to your facebook account (requirement)... you HAVE to tie it to your phone (requirement).... you have to enable GPS on your phone.... I was like, this is too much, I want some privacy jesus, it's not enough that this thing has a camera and a mic on it that feeds into facebook, they have to know everything about you....AND now for the Apps interface.... I had so many problems trying to install the sync app on my PC. On the headset itself the guardian was so annoying, it would ask me to set up my ""space"" everytime I turned the headset on. If I ignored this I would keep seeing these red lines everywhere. Also I HATE that facebook made this thing so limited where you can only play games that facebook selected. You can follow a guide where they (not facebook) give you 20 steps to be able to sideload a game, it's a very hacky way. Omg what a turn off that was.Thank god for hassle free returns. Thanks amazon!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blurry.,"Oh man, I wish I could get that $300.00 back.  Poor quality images.  bulky.  Poor content.  It's a doorstop."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook Ruined the Oculus Brand,"I have had an Oculus Quest for 2 years and loved it. I purchased over 70 apps. I pre-ordered the Quest 2 with high hopes. I never got my apps on the Quest 2, thanks to Facebook and their useless technical support. I created a tech support ticket and after almost 2 weeks of them asking me the same questions over and over with zero resolution, I returned the Quest 2. I will be using another platform moving forward. The only good thing about this purchase was how quickly Amazon credited my account back. I do not recommend Facebook/Oculus Quest until they figure out how to support their long standing customers."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Just like being on Big Brother.,"My Quest 2 is suffering from the Buzzing sound coming from an internal cooling fan. Im now waiting on a second unit as a replacement. That being said, I love my quest two. It does everything relatively well and a great entry level Headset. The build quality at first glance was great, only issue being a buzz that completely eliminates the immersion of an experience especially through the quieter scenes. Im hoping my second unit’s  the charm and functions as it should. Another Huge Negative is forcing a FaceBook account. Be warned, if you don't have a FB that you are constantly using or you plan to create an illegitimate account. They could possibly ban you. Ive been able to look past the juggernaut that is facebook data collection and still really enjoy my device. That being said the question of what is happening behind the scenes with whatever data FB decides to collect  is very uncomfortable. I personally have given Facebook up and had no plans to return. The fact that i cannot use an oculus account without  linking it to a FB is beyond frustrating. For that reason alone i have rated one star and plan on moving out of the oculus environment as soon as a competitor picks up the gauntlet. Ohh and my eye glass also has those sharp cut edges that look like broken glass others have mentioned as well."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Worst Oculus VR headset,Took me a few hours to set it up since I had to create several Facebook accounts. It doesn't even let me play the games in my library. It is heavier and less comfortable than the Rift S. Will return immediately. Not what expected.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Couldn't make a Facebook account to use the thing.  You don't own this hardware even after purchase.,"I am a VR enthusiast.  I own most of the mainline VR headsets (Vive, Vive Pro, Index, Quest 1, Cosmos) and play VR a *ton*This headset is an atrocity to the fundamental rights to ownership of your hardware.Imagine if being blocked by Facebook disabled every device you own.  All your computers, game consoles, monitors/TVs, controllers, phones, headsets, all movies, music, and apps you have ever purchased.  This is the future we will all live in if people allow travesties like this VR headset to thrive.  Do not buy this unless this is the future you want to encourage.Facebook has the power to block/ban/deny you an account for any reason they see fit and even revoke your ability to use your device you paid for.  Even though I haven't done anything wrong, I am one of those people that has been denied.  If your device/account gets banned and you're outside the return window, you're SOL and have a multi-hundred-dollar brick on your hands.  Good thing I was able to return my device (thanks, Amazon).  I encourage everyone that owns a Quest 2 to return their device.  This is unacceptable.I don't care if your kid wants this for their Birthday.  If you want a decent future for your children, you will not buy this for them.If we live in a future where some power hungry, greedy, malicious company like Facebook is allowed to control the lives of people in this way, we are damning ourselves to a future of subservience and slavery.  Giving up rights is a slippery slope.Also, the first one I received had charging issues.  After I opened it from the box, and it shoved an update down my throat I put the headset down and went away, came back much later in the day and it was dead.  Plugged it up, and it was weird with charging.  I could get it to turn on sometimes but it wouldn't go above a few percent and kept discharging.  I made an exchange and the second one I got all the way to needing to sign up for a Facebook account and Facebook refused to allow me to have an account.  There are no people to contact to help me -- it's like Google's customer service.  There are no people to contact, there is no support.  There are only bots and computers and they will block/ban you and deny you the ability to use the hardware you paid for with literally no way to contact anyone to ask why or argue -- see my screenshot.  ""We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed""."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,beware of facebook,"build quality is not as good as the 1st Oculus, but then again, the newer version is cheaper.the only major downside is that you cannot use this headset without merging your Oculus account into a facebook account. this means you're now coupled to facebook no matter what, and for someone like me who doesn't use/like/or approve of facebook or any other social media it's the biggest deal breaker ever.i will use the content i already purchased but i will never buy something else for Oculus and i will probably sell it pretty soon because Facebook left me no choice but leaving the Oculus platform as well.bad show."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Do not purchase the Quest 2,"The device itself is impressive.  But the support offered after the sale, is the worst I've ever experienced.  I owned the Quest 1, and bought lots of games.  When I received the Quest 2, it asks you to consolidate with your Facebook account.  I did so, having an active Facebook account for 10+ years.  However, after doing so their store would no longer accept any of my payment methods(I've got plenty of valid options, including the one I've used with them for the past years(I bought Rift games too from them).  They will not let me add any payment options, giving an error message.  So I started a case with their customer service team 11 days ago, and nothing has been done.  I follow up with them regularly, and receive no response.  So I've got a great piece of hardware, that I haven't been able to purchase a single game for.  Oculus is clearly never going to resolve the issue for me, their customer service just offers a refund.  I don't want a refund, I want the issue resolved, as now I can't even buy games for my Quest 1 or Rift.  It is so ridiculous.  I've even posted in several Oculus support forums, where they just refer me to open a case which I did 11 days ago, and they do absolutely nothing to try to fix it.  Other people post the same issue in forums and they don't resolve it for anyone."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I HOPE YOU LIKE SPENDING MONEY,"My Facebook account was banned after contacting my oculus account. Because of this it bricked my headset, After i spent close to 200$ all of my games are gone. I will be returning my headset but i will not be able to get my 200$ back. So TLDR don't buy it. Its a scam to get your personal information and money."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Worst Product support ever,"I purchased the Oculus quest 2 and received it in a timely manner after it had been released. I then noticed that there appeared to be a ""dead pixel"" in the left eye piece.  I opened a trouble ticket with Oculus support on 10/15.  After going back and forth with troubleshooting and taking pictures of the unit trying to show the dead pixel and then sending in all of the serial numbers and my shipping address everything went ""silent"". I then received a short reply that my support person ""Gibson"" was out of the office and they would get back to me in 3 to 5 business days and they were still investigating. I then spent the next 2 weeks asking for a reply to my ticket.  I opened a chat and logged a new issue referencing the original and was told that they were still investigating and would get back to me in 24-36 hours. Finally on 11/4 I have a reply.I need to return the defective unit, wait 3 to 5 days for processing after the unit is received, and then they will ship out a new unit. A process that could leave without anything for 2 to 3 more weeks.I should have returned this immediately to Amazon and received my refund and then used my $$ in a more meaningful way."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook needs regulations.,Buyers regret- Yeah sure the technology is impressive but the fact that a Facebook account is REQUIRED is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t care that it’s owned by Facebook this is a gaming system targeted towards kids and teenagers and I’m sorry but minimum age (13) for a social media account is absurd. We will likely be returning this garbage.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Can not get a facebook account! No one to call! No way to call!  Doesn't matter if you can't use it!,"Got this a week ago. Waiting for facebook to contact me to get my account verified. Sent facebook my drivers licence, utility bills, ect and nothing. I have not even opened the box. Oculus was great in their contact. I have 3 older Oculus VR's so i had a account with them. I have no choice but to wait. Oculus can not help. If this does not get resolved soon, i will send it back and kiss Oculus devices goodbuy forever. $400 for a toy i can't use. Imagine getting a new iphone 12 and Apple required you to get a Apple Messenger account to use. You apply and they thank you and say they will get back. AND NOTHING! No reply, no way to contact to see if there is a problem? Also, what if you have a problem in the future? No way to contact!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,What was once great...,"The Oculus Auest 2 is a remarkable VR headset. It’s impressive how much they managed to fit into a a standalone VR setup. The visuals are crisp, the performance is solid, and the tracking, controls and battery life are all solid.Unfortunately all of this is ruined by Zuckerberg’s greed. They took what was once an incredible, crowd sourced VR setup, and turned it into a Facebook tool that requires a Facebook account to use. It also requires you make your full name available on your account, otherwise they will ban you from Facebook. Once you are banned that’s the end of the headset. You now have a $300 paper weight.No VR headset should be held hostage like that. In the blink of an eye you can lose the headset, and all of the games you spent money on, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Unless they remove that requirement, you should steer clear of the Occulus Quest line. Hopefully the lawsuit that was just brought against Zuckerberg changes things for the better."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,PIN snafu will brick your Oculus,"Most of the setup was OK, though far short on basic information someone new to VR would need. However, when I tried to purchase a game it demanded my PIN. Well, I hadn't set a PIN yet. Tried a couple that it would have been if I had actually set a PIN, nothing worked. Went into the app, it wouldn't let me set the PIN because I had to have the ""old"" PIN. Tried a factory reset, same error. Went into the support account, same error. Downloaded the PC app because supposedly I could ""reset"" the PIN there with just my password. Fail. I even tried changing my password, still fail. Support is clueless, says they can't see or change anything. So they've bricked my $400 device because of a fatal snafu in the PIN. Since this is attached to my FB account, I'm afraid this fail may follow me again even after I get this brick replaced."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Oculus Support is the most useless company I've ever worked with,"The actual headset is very nice, but everything else surrounding Oculus and Facebook is the worst experience of my life. Oculus support is flat out useless and will mark your support tickets (that's right they only do support tickets) as ""solved"" without even contacting you. Merging my FB and Oculus accounts straight up broke my Oculus PC app making my quest 2 essentially a brick and nobody seems to know what to do about it. after submitting several tickets and waiting ""3-5 business days"" I've gotten no help and even ignored by Oculus support. So despite the fact ol Mark Zuckyboy lied to all of us about not forcing quest users to make a FB account but he also singlehandedly removed all the excitement for VR that I had. Do yourself a favor and either wait for them fix their broken product or do yourself one better and buy headsets that haven't been tainted by Facebooks malicious little grubby 1% fingers."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Headset works independently, can't get it to work with PC",I can play games and stuff just fine within the system itself. The thing I'm looking to do is play games through steam VR which I HAVE done before using the Oculus Quest 1. The only thing giving me issues is installing the Oculus Setup onto my computer... I have spent 4 hours trying to install it but it says to restart my pc and failed to install every single time. This is an issue that many other people are having and none of the solutions seem to work. I am very upset with this and am angry on how difficult it is to resolve it with no success.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Beautiful headset, worst ecosystem on the planet.","Let me start by saying I really like this headset from a hardware perspective. I upgraded from an original HTC Vive to a Rift S last year, which I replaced with this headset this year. The screen looks great with basically zero screen door effect. There are still some god-rays in certain lighting conditions but it is never so bad as to distract from the experience. The controller batteries last FOREVER compared to pervious controllers I've used. Kudos to them on this.The reason I am making my review so low is the closed ecosystem. When you buy a smartphone, you pay a large sum up front for a device, but there is a nearly infinite number of free apps to keep you distracted or productive for hours at no extra cost, unless you buy in-app purchases. There are also higher quality apps that have a price tag on them, but these are optional.By default, the Oculus Quest has enough free content to keep you engaged for maybe an hour. And most of the apps are literally five minute demos of full games. If you want to buy all the best games, it's gonna be hundreds more dollars out of your pocket.This is because Oculus very closely vets what games can be in it's store, in order to assure quality or some nonsense answer like that. Lots of good developers have had their games excluded for basically no reason. As a software developer myself, I can't imagine how much it would hurt if I spent months developing a game just to have it rejected from the store. I guess there is nothing inherently wrong with Oculus managing the store how it wants, but there have been lots of shadier practices as well. For example, they push back against apps like Bigscreen in favor of their own ""infinite office"" product (which you can't even get yet by the way), and they push back against certain fitness tracking apps in favor of their own app. I won't go as far as to accuse them of plagiarism but they are Facebooking it real hard with the anticompetitive attitude, and I bet Zuck is proud of them.Because of this Zuckery, devs find other ways to distribute their apps. There is a service called SideQuest that allows you to sideload games onto your Quest 2, and without it this device is kind of pointless. All the Oculus store rejects gather there. And, many of the great games on SideQuest are completely free! But the process of installing SideQuest may be a bit difficult for non-technical folks, involving weird steps like creating a developer account.There is also Steam VR, to play all your favorite games you bought already. But really, if the device has 128 gigs of storage now, why can't I just install SteamVR onto the headset itself and play directly from there? Why must I pay 90 dollars for a link cable to play the VR games I already own, including ones from Oculus store? (Yep, that's a thing too) Luckily it isn't all bad, you can pay 35 dollars for a bootleg link cable that will fail after a week. I can't even stress enough how few good games are available without sideloading or using Oculus Link. Even on the back of the box, the games they advertise are BeatSaber (which has been around since I got my Vive almost four years ago) The Climb (which has been around even longer) the next Star Wars game they made (again nothing really new, some eye candy with a Star Wars theme) and three other games that are actually new. Even the box itself hilariously demonstrates the lack of good games because half of them are newer versions of games that already existed. Pretty sure the Rift S box had more games on it but I'd have to dig it out of the closet to confirm.Additionally I've heard other developers say that there is no reason for this device not to run Android apps natively (on a flat screen in 3D space of course), since it is basically an android device. I'm not sure whether this is actually feasible (I'm sure Oculus would say it isn't) but it would drastically increase the amount of stuff you can do with your device.One last rant, the Passthrough mode where you can see your surroundings is great, except there is no way to permanently turn it on. By default it turns on when you leave your play space, and you can set it as your menu environment to have it always on as long as you be a good boy and stay in your play area. But as you begin to get further away from your play area, it darkens the screen until it completely turns off and finally tells you to turn around as you flail like an idiot in pitch dark or take the headset off. I want to be able to go grab a water bottle in the next room without taking it off, and yet there is no way to do this without making and enormous play space that takes up your whole house floor. I just can't understand why, especially with an untethered headset, why they don't trust us to go five feet from the play area. With the improved quality cameras, there is a zero percent chance of me running into anything, at least as long as they are turned on. So why then is it a feature to TURN THEM OFF WHILE YOU ARE WALKIBG AROUND? Facebook literally treats you like cattle. Stay in your enclosure. Oh, and if you turn off the guardian completely, the passthrough is just always complete darkness. Thanks for that. This frustrates me more than anything else and that makes me sad. This headset makes me sad. I don't like being sad. So I don't like this headset.But I will continue to use it because it's pretty and Mark really needs those 3D scans of my living room that are tied to my identity because you must use a Facebook account to log in oh yeah have you heard about th"

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Avoid.,"So having the Q1 & Q2 now for a few months I have to say avoid at all costs.The Quest 2 is inferior to the Quest 1.  The over all build quality on Q1 is superior and is a better more comfortable product.  The Q2 does sport a better processor, 90hz and increased resolution, but the screen quality is inferior and does not look as clear or as crisp.  The Q2 is ""papas headset"" and the Q1 is for the kids, when I use theirs it is staggeringly obvious how much better it looks.The IPD settings (eye distance) is entirely broke on the Q2 so not everyone can focus it properly.On top of all the technical failings the mandatory facebook connection will make your head hurt, first off if you get in trouble on FB they can ban/lock your headset.  Two, for the oculus video you are continually inundated with skewed political content when you go to play games and unwind."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Unusable.,"Bought one as a Christmas present for my (over 13) child. It requires a Facebook account to use, so on Christmas went to create an account for them so they could use it. Immediately upon completing the sign-up wizard, the account was ""disabled"" for ""violating Community Standards"", which is clearly impossible since they are just creating an account. The only recourse is to provide some personal information (such as a photo and a mobile verification, which in and of itself is pretty invasive and problematic since it's for a 13-year-old) and then wait for a team of people to review the account manually and hopefully, maybe, unlock it at some point. Tried creating one for myself as well with my e-mail just to get them rolling, same result.So at this point we've paid for a $300 product that can't be used, until some future point potentially when some person might allow us to use the product. If this was for myself I would immediately return it, but my child has had their heart set on it so we'll wait. Can't give this product few enough stars though. It's literally unusable except as a table decoration."

Cable connects to my Mac but Mac does not support the Oculus app only iPhone does. Oculus app on my PC kept crashing during install. Had to delete all files and re-install app 3 times before it would work. Comes with a very short charging cable. The quest 2 died within a hour of being fully charged. Then both controllers randomly disconnected and will not re-connect. Then the Quest 2 went to a black screen and will not show display. I tried resetting to factory settings. Uninstalling all files, re-installing app and followed multiple online tutorials and videos and I can not get this to work. I keep seeing these same complaints over and over.

My second issue is wow i didn't realize how heavy and uncomfortable it really is. I can't stand using it for more then a few minutes at a time.

Unfortunately for me, Oculus support only seems to check their email once per day, and then when they do, they ask me a single question, which I promptly answer.  Then it takes them ~24 hours for them to review and ask me another single question, to which I promptly answer.  Rinse and repeat.  Why doesn't Oculus Support ask me the whole barrage of questions that they need to get me online as quickly as possible?  I am so upset about this equipment and being unable to use it.  HORRIBLE customer service.  I am ready to send this unit back to Oculus and go with another brand."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A great headset until you need to contact support. Oculus support is pathetic.,"I was an original Rift kickstarter backer. I've used all but one generation of the headset since then, developed enterprise content for Oculus products and been an evangelist for VR and Oculus as a company. The Quest 2 is an impressive, fantastic device - when it is working. That last part is important.I had the misfortune of having issues crop up with my headset several months into use. I am unsure if these are due to a software update, I suspect that they are not. My experience with Oculus support has been so terrible that I would warn anyone considering purchasing their products to consider my support experience as part of their purchase decision.First I searched several forums including reddit and Oculus' forums before trying to contact Oculus support. They have a support page, but it has very little information available, instead you have to engage with their support bot through a chat window.You can request to speak to a human being through the bot. I spoke to several, all at the same support tier. In spite of clearly stating my issue and the headset I was using at various points I was given answers for a Rift headset (different product), Oculus Link/PC issues (not related to my problem, I clearly stated I wasn't using link and was using native apps). The unhelpful, confused responses I received from representatives ranged from repeat suggestions on things I had said were not related (like Oculus Link) to blatant falsehoods.Not helping matters is the fact that the Oculus chat will disconnect you from a representative on mobile if the chat window loses focus, even for a second. After over an hour of trying to get help and ~4+ support reps giving unhelpful suggestions I asked to be elevated to a higher support tier.Instead of elevating directly to another support tier in the chat window, Oculus support instead e-mails you and you have to reply to the email to theoretically get help. This e-mail is a form e-mail asking you to restate your problem. If you respond you will get an identical form e-mail in response. Sometimes two. I have received no less than 25 of these e-mails over a period of 9 days. After four days of no human responses I received two somewhat conflicting human responses, both form-like in content and both telling me that support would help answer questions at some point in the future, maybe 3 days, maybe 5. When I emailed to let them know that their own stated time limit had expired I got the standard, automated form e-mail as response.There is no phone number to call for Oculus support. This is the experience. If you have a very basic problem (e.g. the headset won't turn on) they may be able to help you in a timely manner.Personally I do not have time to deal with the wall of garbage that Oculus offers up as a support experience. Their customers' time and patience appears to have zero value to them. This is a fundamentally disrespectful way to interact with customers and Oculus/Facebook should not be rewarded for it with sales."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Cheap headset with bad design and cheap material,"This is basically a cell phone mounted on a CHEAP $30 buck headset without any cell phone function. The controller has no grip. The headset is too narrow. If you have a medium-large sized head and wear glasses, chances are you will constantly feel deep pain on two sides of you head. The rigid plastic on the two sides of the headset will press hard on the two arms of your glasses. The headset puts a ton of pressure on our cheek bone cause it is front-loaded. You need to spend a ton of money to buy head strap, face pad, controller grip,... The battery charge extremely slowly. Charging time is the same as playing time. You need to spend money either in buying a longer USB wire or an expensive power bank. There is no way you can expand your RAM. You can use sidequest to add memory to it but you cannot store games in the external memory cause your Quest 2 will not recognize the game on your external memory. My Quest 2 had one very bad lens that is blurry with something like a piece of white cloud in it. Even without this defect, the sweet spots of the two lens are extremely narrow. If you move your eyes without moving your head, things will become off focus very quickly. Sound quality is not comparable to other headsets. So, you need to buy some more expensive headstraps with better ear phones. By paying $299, you end up paying over $200 extra on upgrades and replacement. The only strength of this device is that it is wireless. But if you don't use wire connection, you can't really play VR games on a high end PC without lags (say using virtual desktop). That means you need to spend some more money to buy a longer cable, or the results may not be satisfactory for some games. If you buy this for your kids, it is still OK cause most games available are old or childish VR games with very simplistic and/or reduced graphics quality. If you want to play some serious AAA VR games, like VR sim racing, you simply cannot because of the serious lack of RAM and the lack of a functional graphics CPU. This device is for first time VR players. Just don't do any upgrades or replacement. Wait for the VR gaming market to improve in a year or two. Then buy something with much higher quality at only a little higher cost."

Well guess what?  Then it tells you ""We will share the information we gather about you and your use of Facebook and Oculus.""  We WILL share!  We WILL spy on you!  I am outraged -- talk about a Bait and Switch.  The younger generation doesn't do Facebook they think it is lame, so Mark Zuckerberg must have concocted this ridiculous strong armed way to FORCE them to get Facebook accounts.  Which would be bad enough, but then you  cannot even Opt-Out of them spying on you?  AND spying on your smart phone?  This is so machiavellian that I will not only return this stupid Oculus but I am also going to cancel my own Facebook account, and I am paying the difference out of MY pocket for my son to have a HTC Vive or Valve Index.  He should not be punished after working so hard to save up to buy this, but there is no way I am playing into these Facebook information spy games disguised as a VR headset."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Don't bother if you're planning to share one headset,"I was willing to accept the fact that I needed a Facebook account to use this. Wasn't thrilled that Facebook could brick your device at any point if they decided your profile violated TOS in any way. What made me return the Oculus is the fact that you can't use multiple fb accounts on one headset without completely wiping it before signing into a different account. Oculus/Facebook would like every person in the household to have their OWN headset. Apparently there are ""plans"" to develop a multiple sign-on feature that was announced in August but there are no updates on that progression. I think it's ridiculous that a social media site can dictate what I can do with a product I pay for, but I'm not playing that game."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,OK so we are onto our third unit to try to get one that isn't blurry - Yes we have experience!,"We are now awaiting our third Oculus Quest 2 to show up. The first one had good lenses but now has 2 dead pixels, squeaky controllers and looses connectivity when you turn around too much. We love the product but it seems Oculus has no quality control on what seems to be a difficult item to manufacture with precision. We have read of people going through 12 units to get a good one...  Maybe the quality is going down as our first two units were initially very very good. Over time one set has started to fail after 4 weeks. But thinking about it -  4 weeks isn't very long!! If you go down this road make sure you have stamina for returning - reordering the product..."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook RUINS the product,"Can't play any games that require a pc because you can't sign into your Oculus account on a computer.  I'm in a loop.  It prompts you to sign into Facebook, you sign into Facebook, it prompts you to sign into your Oculus account, repeat, repeat.  Wanna watch someone play on your phone screen?  It says you can do it with your Oculus account.  Only problem, you get on the same exact sign in loop.  If you're thinking you wouldn't merge your Facebook account to your Oculus, wrong.  It requires you to.  Facebook is more concerned with mining our data than giving us a good game system.  I'm not even going to attempt to describe my utter disgust with this system.  According to reddit, ppl have been having this problem for since the product was released, and customer support has no answer.  How hard could it be to let me sign into the Oculus account I'm required to setup to use the headset?"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awful customer service from Oculus,I've been trying to get refunded on over 300 in unauthorized charges for over a month. I asked for the refund within days of my paypal acct being charged. The games were not even downloaded to the system. They have no customer service phone number. Only email. They take days within reply. Each reply is from a different rep. They keep asking for information already provided. The last email they are telling me my 12 year old should not be using the headset because its intended for 13 and up. But some games for the headset are rated E for everyone. I see nothing on Amazon that says the system is for only 13 and up. And what this has to do with them refunding unauthorized charges is just a way for them to furthur stall the refund.The product is very cool worth the price. Just dont link your pay information.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I Regret This Impulsive Purchase,"the Guardian feature is one of the most annoying features ever added to anything, ever. It has never come in handy once and seems to only exist to annoy the user. I keep getting warned that I’m about to “hit my boundary” when i’m stationary in bed watching a video. however, when i’m actually doing a physical activity, my arm collided with my wall with ZERO WARNING from the Guardian system! this is proof it only exists to irk the user, and the only way to turn it off is to have it so dark in your room that the Guardian can’t tell the boundary. this is hard to explain but i think users will know what I’m talking about. besides that, it’s not as revolutionary as I expected, the quality was not much better than the VR on my Android phone. the Facebook account thing is an atrocious thing to require of a customer, but didn’t affect me much because I have a Facebook. there is no easy simple way to update apps. i definitely regret my purchase and wish I had invested in one of Steam’s VR sets, as those seem to have a lot more flexibility in what they can do than the Oculus."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Vpn could cause device to not update durring setup making the device useless.,Head set would never get past the update screen. Tech support was useless. Tried everything. Was paired to phone and connected to wifi and my facebook account. Dont understand why I it needs two different internet sources at same time to run. Finally concluded that since I use vpn the ip for the phone and my wifi were different and thus that was the reason for not working. What BS is that! So beware if you have to use a vpn. Had to return the headset.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"0 stars, awful device.","Unfortunately, the Amazon page isn't smart enough to realize that 0 stars IS a selected star rating.After taking forty minutes to even begin trying to set up.  The device was uncomfortably small.  As a big guy with glasses and a big head this was designed for children even though the minimum age was 13.The connection USB cable DOESN'T WORK.  It constantly loses connection no matter what you do.  For five minutes, the most reliable game I could play on it was ""you're connected to a PC"" ""Connection lost"".  Followed by ""It's too dark in your brightly lit room to track"".  Great games.Setting it up uses 65% of the battery power even while it's connected to charge.Whatever idiot thought that this piece of cell-phone based garbage would EVER replace a PCVR system should not only be fired, they should be removed from any position to ever make decisions affecting anyone, including themselves, as they obviously can't be trusted to think more than one step ahead.Some major issues.  All of the buttons are exactly where you need to hold the visor to move it.  Power off.  If you're not one of the incredibly trendy, fit, small-framed people they show using it, you won't be able to.  It's not designed for the masses, it's designed for trendy hipsters, who wouldn't want it.  If you've EVER used a PC based VR system you will find this an incredible let down.Here's hoping the government splits up Farcebook so they have to let someone with a clue work on the Oculus.I picked up both the Rift S and the Quest 2.  I'll keep the Rift S as it works and will be returning this POS tonight.  Sorry, Amazon.TL;DR:  Don't waste your time.  Get a PCVR system.  It will be a much, much better experience."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Temper Your Expectations,"This unit is not what they advertise it to be. Too many corners cut makes for a tough VR experience:1. It is too heavy to workout with. My wife is small and this unit created terrible neck strain even with a battery pack strapped to the back for balance. It dug into my nose and cheek bones rather hard no matter how we adjusted it.2. The lenses are blurry and cannot be properly adjusted. Sliding them closer or father apart helps only a little. I have binoculars from 1972 with adjustable lenses. Just saying.3. Media resolution is lousy. Games are nowhere near detailed enough and videos are so blurry they'll make your eyes water. And yes, I installed the bracket for wearing glasses but saw only marginal improvement. The media is low resolution.4. Limited library of available content. What is available is juvenile in the extreme.5. Chromecasting Ultra is really needed to get any sort of decent video casting from the headset to a television.6. Some apps don't allow Chromecasting. You won't know until you buy them because the store's description of the app won't tell you.7. If the unit doesn't feel the face pressure it expects, it turns off and corrupts your game...repeatedly. If you look down at your feet, you decrease face pressure because gravity pulls the unit toward the ground. It's like wearing a diving mask to keep that pressure strong enough.8. Changing who is wearing the device requires completely exiting a game first or it will shut off and corrupt the game. There is no ""pause"" feature to prevent such a thing from happening.9. Most games won't let you lie down and play. If you're disabled, forget it. That's not a flaw with the unit.10. If you've never been in VR before, it's really amazing for about 10 minutes until your eyes start to burn, water, and blur or a headache starts. I was able to build up my tolerance to about 15-minutes with 10-minute breaks. Not really immersive for a hardcore gamer like me.11. I have boxed the unit back up in its original packaging and printed the RMA label. Makes me sad. I really tried to like it."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"No true ""sweet spot"" for unblurry graphics, and awful customer support on Oculus site and Facebook","Graphic quality is always blurry, no sharp text, watch youtube videos of actual games being played not some youtuber just showing their desktop game view. Thought graphics would be nicer and clearer, but imagine 99% of your screen is unfocused. Watched more videos (+3 hr worth) on trying to correct this than actually playing anything on it, tried everything, the technology just isn't there yet. Also, my face hurts from how tight you have to strap this heavy thing to it, even with a much better 3rd party head strap.Also, good lucky trying to contact an actual person from Facebook or Oculus if something is off about their product or you're experiencing issues with Facebook, THEY DO NOT CARE, worse customer service ever, it is nonexistent, no phone number or email contact to find of their site, because of this I rated 1 star, actual product is 3 stars."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Got massive headaches within hours,"I never get headaches. These were extreme pains on both sides of my brain which is no surprise considering how much data is wirelessly being sent directly adjacent to my head... I ordered an EMF ""hood"" (silver lined) basically a tin foil hat, today in hopes that it helps. Never had a problem with EMF. Also was never a big fan of the whole smart phone thing so apparently I'm sensitive to these things now? Other than that I love it. I'm impressed. But I'm giving it one star because it's owned by a CIA-controlled Communist Chinese puppet, Mark Zuckerburg and he requires you to have a facebook account. I used a ""jailbreak"" loophole and signed up as an oculus ""developer"" and have full access to everything. I would have used my fb account but my fb account was permanantely banned 2 years ago because I had a facebook group with 350,000 people and it was pro-Trump. So that's where we're at now... Looking forward to seeing fb being brought down eventually."

Bought one for my niece and she can't use because she is under 13. Can't add her to my account because FaceBook is canceling accounts for having more than ONE Oculus.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Bad setup,BAD setup!! The set up seems easy it walks you through each step and you think you are all ready to go BUT then you try to purchase a game it tells you to enter your PIN. There was never a prompt to set up a PIN while setting up your account( done by syncing with your Facebook). In the app has a place to reset your PIN but since you never set up a pin the you can’t change it because you have to know the previous PIN. So anyone thinking about getting this for your kids for Christmas make sure you set it up because Customer Service takes one to two business days to get back to you if you send them a support request.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,BUYER BEWARE! FACEBOOK IS GREEDY!! You will need to re-purchase games!,"So let me start off this review by saying that I was very excited to get my hands on one of these for my husband. He would not stop talking about how he wanted the new Oculus Quest 2. Needless to say that this product failed to meet our expectations. It is very upsetting, because this product is honestly being held back by Facebook. It could have been a fantastic product.So I will explain my thought process around my star rating.TWO stars removed because of game library limitations: So, Facebook does not advertise this headset as a ""new generation"" of headset. Instead they just make it seem as if you are getting the latest and greatest ""VR Headset"" that comes with all the bells and whistles. I did not know that Facebook considered this headset an entirely different platform. Meaning if I purchased a game on the Oculus Rift, which I did, I would have to buy it again for the Quest version. What does this mean? What is the difference? Exactly. I did not know there was a difference. Its not public, and lots of people don't talk about this. Here is the rundown:Essentially, I could play the game I purchased for the Oculus Rift Platform via two ways: 1.) through the Oculus link setup (which has the USB-C cable hooked up to it) but in this case why even use the Quest headset? I bought it so my husband wouldn't have to be tied up with a cable. 2.) Oculus Air Link, which requires you to basically stream your PC running the game, to your headset. So a wireless version of Quest link. I wish I would have known about this option. BUT AGAIN, Facebook did not make this a known feature whenever we were setting up the headset. So no matter what I would have to ""link"" with my PC in order to play titles that I had already purchased. Also Note: Air Link was an absolute nightmare for me, and was constantly stuttering and was barely playable on games like Beat Saber. So the normal Cable ""Quest Link"" was my only real option to play titles that I had already purchased.ALSO NOTE: that this does not go the other way! If you buy the Quest version of a game, you will be stuck with the mobile version and will not be able to play it at a higher resolution / graphic fidelity on your PC. You are just stuck with a toned down version of whatever game you purchased for the Quest Version. So if you were thinking of getting the Quest, and buying a whole bunch of VR games, and then get a VR rig later down the road to play those games at a higher resolution to get a better overall experience, that will NOT WORK!! You will have to re-purchase those games as well!!!That is exactly what happened to us. So we get into the dashboard looking for Beat Saber, and Super Hot and a bunch of other titles that we had already purchased on the Oculus Rift. And to our surprise, it kept showing ""Buy now"". We kept having to search for why we couldn't play the games we had already PURCHASED! It turns out that Facebook essentially toned down the graphics on these games and labeled it as a more ""mobile"" version that could be played JUST using the headsets hardware, essentially deeming it as a completely different version of the game. THAT IS BS!! A crappier version of the SAME GAME. That you have to re-purchase because of hardware changes. I understand that this is like a new console generation, and that you cannot expect to get the latest and greatest graphics and ""next gen"" performance for free. But I feel like this is going backwards. The games are clunkier and have the resolution and graphic fidelity toned way down! And I am being charged full price for the game!!?? What are you thinking Facebook!? At least have an option to purchase the ""Quest version"" for a small fee if you have already purchased a game. For instance. Beat Saber. Its a $29.99 game. If you had already purchased the full version for the Oculus Rift, pay a $5 fee for the ""link-free"" Quest version.Instead we were just thrown into the dashboard and we couldn't find our appsOne star removed for ease of access: Facebook does state that you will need a Facebook account to setup and access the Quest Marketplace ""Oculus Quest 2 requires your Facebook account to log in, making it easy to meet up with friends in VR and discover communities around the world"". I think this step should be optional, like, hey playing with your friends would be easier with a Facebook account, but of course Facebook has to push its Social Network in your face and strong arm you into using it.Another star removed because of privacy!! BUYER BEWARE, your settings automatically come public about what you are playing on your profile and when you are online in VR. You have to manually change this inside the Oculus app. I wish this setting would be handled in the VR setup and not through your Oculus profile on the Oculus website."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Goggles are okay. Buying more games? Horrible.,In order to buy games for these you must set up an account with their store and agree to have them keep your credit card info or PayPal account information on file. There is no way to securely purchase without giving them Total Access to your account information. There is no guest checkout.  So if I buy a game my child then has carte blanche for future purchases.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,defective,"After having it for 2 days I have begun to see malfunctioning. Right now it is at the point where it does not work out at all. You cannot play any of your games pretty much if you do not have a boundary and in order to have one, your ""tracking"" needs to be working. After spending a lot of time researching and watching videos I noticed others have had this problem. However, they were able to fix it by restarting. This is not the case for me. I have almost spent $100 on games to not be able to play with them because my quest 2 console doesn't work. I reached out to customer service to exchange it for another one but no response yet."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Failed product - wait for something actually designed for users,"Overall a complete disappointment. 1) a facebook account is *required* 2) the oculus pin created at the website can't be used on the device itself 3) Any failure in Wifi causes the device to become inoperable.The big selling point here is that the headset is untethered. Unfortunately it is ""tethered"" plenty in other ways. I can't recommend this to anyone until this product is fixed. $500 is too much to spend for a technophilic advertisement for Facebook. I can't believe the Oculus division produced this drug."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Aggressive Facebook policies ruin Quest 2,"I'm in the process of seeking a refund on my Oculus Quest 2 games, which will likely result in a credit card dispute.  The headset is a marvel but is tightly bound to your Facebook account, which overshadows the advantages of the device.  Since I'm in the process of deactivating my Facebook account, I can no longer access the games I purchased.  (This would apply to you if you get banned from Facebook as well).  The leverage that privacy-parasite Facebook is applying to Oculus games and account status should be illegal under anti-trust law.  I'd recommend anyone selecting Oculus create a Facebook account for just the VR  purpose.  But the danger is Facebook can ban you at any time for violating their Facebook policies, which have nothing to do with Oculus.  It is all very frustrating and I'd recommend avoiding this platform altogether."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,What a headache,"I didn't want to create a Facebook account, but figured how painful could it be.  After my new FB account is up and running I start setting up my Quest 2.  It somehow tries to link to my old deleted Oculus account ... tells me that I need to contact Oculus support to re-activate.  No problem, I send them an email with my login information for the old oculus account ... they take 3 days to respond and request about 5 things which I no longer have, like serial number for my original oculus.  I send them the information that I have, and explain why I no longer have the other information ... they take another 3 days to respond without being of any help whatsoever.  Packed up the headset and sent it back.  Life is too short."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,1 star because of facebook,"The device itself is awesome.  The titles and things you can do are pretty good.  I think it obviously needs more content.  The navigation is awesome.  The ""lobby"" where you browse titles is really cool.My biggest gripe is this facebook integration.  I don't like that at all. Why should I need a facebook account to use this device?  Why should this device have anything to do with my existing facebook account?  I created a ""burner"" facebook account but didn't realize for the phone app that it will basically more or less force you to use your existing facebook app login.It's partly privacy because FB is terrible about privacy, but it's also just the weirdness of connecting some device like this with a facebook account.  I disabled all interactivity between my FB account and the oculus but I don't trust that FB isn't collecting data through the oculus.  Which is just weird."

Facebook is for 13 and older so it’s an egg chicken situation.The app is needed more than you think, so If you sign in with fb account in the kid’s iPad they’ll have access to your Facebook account in each crappy game or app they have on their phone.My kid downloaded fb and had immediate access to the account.Stay away from it if you value your kid’s privacy and you want them to stay away from social networks"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Beware - Ads and a Facebook Account,"I immediately stopped this order and am glad I did not buy it. It's cheap because Facebook is using you as the product. Now, they will also be testing ads on it despite the hefty price tag. And no, even if you make a fake account, Facebook will figure it out based on your IP. If the company suspects a fake account, you no longer can use the device. Oh, and nobody else can sign in from a different account, making your device useless. Save your money and don't support this scam of a device."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"This is a very cool item, however","I have had 2 different units at this point and each one has had some sort of hardware issue. The first one the handsets just decided to not register anything anymore and Amazon graciously replaced that one. I received my replacement last week and this one has the sound cut off randomly only to be fixed by resetting the headset. This would be fine if it were occasional but this occurs at least 3 times in a 2 hour period so it is very frequent. Amazon, sadly, couldn't replace this one due to the item now being out of stock but did offer a small refund which was kind of them but this is disappointingThe issue of requiring Facebook isn't the hugest issue since you can just use an account you don't use very much, but the UI is not very user-friendly. It can be hard to find where your most recent purchases are and the device doesn't seem to like you making purchases in the device itself but on the app (which feels entirely useless. The app doesn't really do anything and I frequently forget it even exists).At this point, I don't feel like this system is really worth the money and I would advise spending the money on a different VR system."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Keep Your Quest 1 Another Year,"Just an overall bad device.  Poor focus on the lense edges.  Bad ""sweet spot"" attainment. Pupillary distance is smaller and comes in three presets, not a slider bar. The foam around the eyes falls apart, whereas the Quest 1 has neoprene. The head strap is elastic and smaller than the Quest 1, poor quality yet again.  Q2 doesn't truly weigh less than the Q1, only the mediocre head strap makes this claim true.  The overall width is smaller and actually less comfortable than the original.  Battery life is the same or worse than the Q1.  The Quest 2 is faster and has higher resolution, but suffers in build quality and other hardware deficiencies in an attempt to bring the price down by cutting corners.  Oh, and you NEED a Facebook account. I'd rather pay more to get what I want as a VR enthusiast.  I'm keeping my Quest 1 and seeing what other vendors will be offering in the near future.  Shame on Facebook engineers for letting this junk out the door.  Break up Facebook and let Oculus do what it was originally meant to do!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Worked for only 2 months,"The ideal experience is very fun and this unit is the cheapest way to get good VR currently on the market. However...After 60 days of occasional use the tracking ability is completely shotWe have ""babied"" this device by keeping it under a microfiber cloth when not in use, never taking it outside or exposing it to direct sunlight.However, every time the unit boots up the first 30-60 seconds are an error message that the Oculus cannot establish tracking. If it cant track, it doesnt work, and you cannot set a guardian.When it clears up sometimes, you can get past this and start a game but during the game your guardian just disappears and your game is probably gonna crash or get corrupted if this happens too often.We have hundreds of dollars into the Oculus but now they're telling me that this sudden issue should have been fixed by completely wiping all my data off and let me tell you that is no fun if you've gone to much work to get games etc... you want on this thing.I would buy, but br VERY wary and get THE STRONGEST return policy or extended warranty coverage you can, and at the first sign of trouble just take it back - if I have to re-set up my whole experience I would rather do it on a new headset instead of one that is clearly having issues already."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Useless - would never pair with modern Android phone,"Hardware wise, really slick package at an amazing price.  Too bad I'll never know how it works, as it will not pair with my LG Android (8.0) phone, even though both are connected to the same wifi.  The ""help"" page linked in the Oculus app for debugging pairing issues, says I kid you not ""After your headset is paired, tap Controller or Headset Problem?, then select Connect Wi-Fi.""!  That is the extent of their troubleshooting help.  Totally, astoundingly, useless."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Doesn’t live up to the hype at all. Very much still a product in the works.,"Honestly it’s not really that great. I expected a lot from this and it did not live up to the hype at all. The graphics aren’t NEARLY as good as what people hyped them up to be. There aren’t even a lot of apps to go with this thing yet......not sure if developers will be creating more but I was seriously underwhelmed.....not even with the gaming but with just the options to explore. There were several apps I went on that took you to different countries and the image quality was poor at best. Blurry sometimes and slightly hi quality at others. The only thing I really love is the attention and detail they put into safety (which makes sense because I imagine they don’t want to be held liable for anything). But coming from someone who loves gaming and hi def, beautiful things this was just extremely underwhelming. Not really worth the money imo and it’s not even that comfortable. Easy for the vision to get blurry no matter how much you adjust it. All the games cost money as well which isn’t a deal breaker but is annoying and just thought you all should know. Overall VERY okay but not worth the price point and kind of disappointing/boring. It’s very easy to tell that this is still a product in the works."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Owned by facebook and requires facebook account to use,Can't speak to anything else but thought someone else might like to know that before they buy it.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,FACEBOOK ACCOUNT REQUIRED.  COULD BE BIG WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.,BEWARE !!!!!If somebody at Facebook doesn't  like your this product will be USELESS.Facebook is being sued by the German government because of this.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Useless headset after spending over $400 because I can't logon to FACEBOOK!!!!,"i never get on facebook.  I don't like facebook.  I got my VR goggles..surprise!! I need a facebook account.  And now trying to setup a facebook account and all of a sudden it's telling me for security, I have to send in some id, photo or other item for them to review before I can log in to face book which is required to use my VR I just purchased for over $400.00.  I'm a person who firmly believe that the more information you place on the web the more chances you are of being a target of fraud and mischief.  Facebook need to make this a chose and not have people forced to login to facebook and provide them personal items.  If this is how they contact business for consumer products, they need to be broken up into separate companies.  I should not need to provide such items to them when I'm not interested in social media ... period!!!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Virtually useless,"If, like me, you were considering the Quest 2 as an upgrade to the Oculus Go, it is not.  It is a step down from everything that headset does well. The Quest 2 does not natively support DLNA streaming, so if you're used to watching content from your own home server/PC, you can't.  There are third party apps available to do this, but at the cost of reduced video quality (poorer frame rate).Ergonomically it's a huge step down also.  It's heavy, and impossible to keep attached to your face unless you tighten the straps so tight that it's painful.  The headset is also narrower, so if you wear glasses, they don't really fit into the eye area, even with the included glasses adapter installed.Long story short, if intend to use this for media streaming, it fails on all counts.  This will not be the VR headset for you.Also, you probably know this already, but it requires a Facebook account to use the headset, which should have been a deal breaker in itself.  As in, you literally cannot use the headset in anyway without a Facebook logon."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Extremely Painful! Shame on Oculus for releasing a poorly designed headset.,"Don't buy this.  Wait or look at another vendor's offerings.Oculus PMs and GMs should have listened to those engineers and focus group customers that said that this was designed poorly, waited to release it and gone back to the drawing board (or CAD program).  The battery doesn't belong on the user's face.  It should have been put on the back of the head because the weight of the headset is all on the forehead and cheekbones.  I tried a few solutions to this, including wearing a bump cap underneath with a string lifting the weight from the side arms, getting an upgraded, aftermarket solid strap, face pads,etc.  Nothing relieved the weight without causing the headset to move around while I was playing.Not all of us have a beautifully bulb shaped skull, so you can't rely solely on the strap to cradle your head.I have a Rift also.  I can play for hours in the unit.  I can only stand the Quest for about 15 minutes."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Massively Disappointed in $300 i can't play with others,Right after the return window passed the voice control when your in multi-player stopped working. Now can't play with any one that's at a different residence. I can hear them they can not hear me in any multi-player function now i can't play with anyone unless there next to me so they can hear me. Took all the fun out of playing now that i can only play by my self.  This shouldn't have had a defective this early in owning it. Disapointed took away what i bought it for to play with family an friends now i can't.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,To easy for Facebook to make your investment worthless,"I think we all are ok with the requirement to link our Facebook account to the Quest 2 for them to make money on our personal information. Otherwise, we wouldn't be using Facebook. Well, at least we tolerate it.The issue is, many people are getting banned or locked out their Facebook account for arbitrary reasons that have nothing to do with playing games on Oculus. Also, there is little to no recourse. So, if Facebook ever decides that you are locked out or banned (for any reason), you can no longer use your Quest 2.Just be aware that Facebook can, at will, make your $300+ investments on Quest 2 & Games, worthless. Hopefully Facebook will implement a better policy. Until then, i will gladly pay more for a product without strings attached.Hope this helps."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,A very expensive paper weight,"I was so excited when I got this.  The left controller didn't work but I put in a new battery and it was fine.  A bit blurry with some videos but overall excellent.  The next day, had the same problem with the controller.  Third day, same thing so I used the chat feature on the Oculus site to get help.  A very pleasant guy helped me trouble shoot for almost two hours.  He said he wanted me to try something that they were getting a lot of complaints about.  He had me do a factory reset.  Which then caused my headset to get stuck in an endless loop.That was a few days ago.  Yesterday, I got an email asking if it was just my controller not working or if the headset was still stuck in the loop.  I responded.  That's the last I've heard.  Very, very disappointed."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Won't connect to WiFi, can't even turn WiFi on during setup","The headset won't turn on WiFi during initial setup, and the app won't connect to Wifi either.  The mobile app.  On my mobile phone.  The mobile phone that's connected to the exact Wifi that the app can't seem to find.Even better, someone had the genius idea to block access to the settings until setup is finished.  Can't make this stuff up.  ""Turn on WiFi to continue"" it says, while providing exactly 0 paths to turning on WiFi.  Well, supposedly it can be done remotely - with the mobile app - but I think I covered that bit already.Turns out this is a common problem.  If only Facebook could raise a little money so they could afford a proper team to...oh wait"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Does not work with glasses!,"My glasses barely fit inside and had to bend slightly to fit. The dimensions said they should fit but they didn't and forcefully pressed against my nose the entire time. The glasses spacer barely helped, and no matter what I did, I had to squint to even read the instructions. The straps did nothing to help, don't bother getting this unless your willing to pay 80$+ on some third-party prescription lenses. Besides that, the Oculus Link never worked properly, making this horrible crackling sound that wouldn't go away no matter what I did, and there's currently no official solution to this. I used a third-party cable but the Oculus App on my desktop said it was sufficient, and my computer was more than capable of running it. Complete waste of time if you're not lucky enough to have perfect 20/20 vision."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Came defective,"So, after my son's long awaited excitement of having an Oculus Quest 2 came to an end... he found himself quite heart-broken when he realized that his new Quest was totally defective.  It was stuck in a start-up loop.  He couldn't even finish setting it up because about 10 seconds into the intro, it would simply restart again over and over and sometime would simply freeze half-way through.  We tried restarting it and even got into the Factory reset and tried that, but no luck.  It simply was defective right out of the box and we had to return it.  My son just ordered the 64GB version to try that out and hopefully that one arrives in working condition."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Left Controller DOA, Tech Support is slow.","My unit kept getting stuck on ""Setup"".  I first spoke with their Tech Support two and a half weeks ago (12/30), and we determine that it was stuck on the Left Controller's firmware update.  I RMA'ed the Left Controller which was received by Oculus on 1/12.  They said that they were going to send a replacement, but I still have not received any shipping notification, one week later.  Dealing with Oculus has been one long ordeal.Yes, I could have returned the whole unit to Amazon for a replacement, but I would have to wait until Amazon had the units back in stock.  Plus I would run the risk of receiving a defective replacement and going through the whole cycle again."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Chronic migraine for weeks after use,"I had been suffering from post concussion syndrome for years after a bike accident. The past few years however I had been pain free after finally finding effective treatment....until I tried the Oculus Quest 2. Now my migraines are back with a vengeance and my medication doesn't seem to work anymore. My symptoms started immediately after a 30 minutes session on the Quest 2. First only nausea but in the days after my symptoms worsened and now also include chronic migraines, sound sensitivity,  light sensitivity and vertigo. Its been weeks since my 1st VR session and my symptoms are still persisting. I regret the day I put this thing on. VR might be fun for most people but be careful if you have a history of migraines because this might trigger and even worsen it."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook requirement = failed product,"The hardware itself is amazing, unfortunately, it requires a Facebook account to activate.  The advertisement indicates an oculus smartphone app is required, and we only assumed Facebook was needed for playing with friends.  In reality, Facebook is required to set up and use the device and that is about as lame as it gets!""Easy Setup - Just open the box, set up with the smartphone app and jump into VR. No PC or console needed. Requires wireless internet access and the Oculus app (free download) to set up device"""
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,This is a piece of junk.,I think Facebook is paying Amazon to out this as a 5 star product and sellbit as an Amazon choice. You can't even use the stupid thing unless you are verified trough Facebook and if you don't have one they want you to mail your ID to them to use the 500 dollar device that used to work with an Oculus account. I regret buying this piece of junk that isn't even worth it.

My son contacted the Co. and now has to send it in for repair. Not at all satisfied!!!!! Would not buy again or recommend!!!Will update on customer service.... update... Been 10 days since we contacted customer service & still NO RESPONSE!!! Not at all happy w/ the way it is being handled!! Will just end up returning to Amazon as defective & get a different oculus headset..."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook bs is unavoidable,my major complaint is that you must have Facebook account just to turn the damn thing on. Additionally the should include this in beginning of description and not having buried somewhere at very bottom since it would be one of deciding factors for me to avoid oculus
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,If you have an older cell phone - DO NOT GET THIS!,Its been 18 days since I received this item and it is STILL not able to get registered on the app. And support has been just  a HUGE circle jerk. I have my phone and headset basically sitting on the router and the headset right nest to the phone and the app can't find the headset - sits with that message for hours. Did a factory reset 3 times so far - and still cannot register the headset! VERY DISAPPOINTED so far - Trying not to give up - but if I cannot even register the device to use it what use is it?
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Quest Becomes Disabled,"I like the Quest VR system, but I don’t recommend it.  It requires a Facebook account and if you post or say something they don’t agree with,  they will disable your FB account and not tell you why.  This makes your Quest and games useless.  They won’t even listen to you.  They will say the decision is final and can’t be overturned."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Disappointed,"This is a cool product and our grandson loved it except we could not pair the second controller to the headset, making it no fun at all. No matter what we did, I.e. going online to troubleshoot, etc. still no luck. Tried to order a new controller. No one has them due to product being so new on the market. We emailed the manufacturer, but no response for 3 days now. Very disappointing.  We are returning it and will re-order."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Okay wireless headset, but....Facebook","I bought the Quest 2 because I had one of the original Rift headsets and I needed a new one. I do not and will never buy apps on the oculus store, I have all my games on SteamVR, but the process to get this thing set up was annoying, and that's being generous.Steps to set this up just to connect to PC and play my Steamvr games....1) Turn on, put on, it says to connect to the internet.2) Take off and put back on several times because you have to see your router's annoyingly long password to enter it on the vr screen. It doesn't say you can press the button on the router, which would be way faster and only require removing the headset once.3) Now it says to Download app on phone. Won't connect to PC without a phone app, even with pc application installed.4)After installing phone app, Facebook account is required. I haven't been on this site in a decade....5)Try to log on, it asks me to contact 3 people I haven't spoken to in years to get a code to enter in just so I can reset my password. For some reason my e-mail address isn't good enough anymore. This was 3 'friends' including a joke page with a dog from 2005, and one person that I think is dead. Can't use any other option and can't select from a list of different friends...wtf facebook?6) Create a burner account on Facebook until I can regain access to my old one (let's see how long customer service takes...). I'm here to play games, not chat with people, many of which are just pretending to be my friends so Facebook can collect data to sell!Also, I know what the terms of service say. If they really want to ban my account and lock my other one forever, they lose access to my money and my personal data forever. Arguably I win in this situation, as I can always buy an HTC or similar headset since all my games are on Steam anyways! Only reason I went with the Quest 2 is because it's so cheap and I was curious how it would work wired to a PC and/or connected wirelessly....7) Headset has a six digit key that I have to memorize, take headset off, and punch in my phone....no wait! lol, nevermind! the phone did it automatically...so why was this step even necessary?!?8) Wait for updates. This is a half year old product so it will have updates. Only reasonable step on this list.9) Now, I can finally connect to the PC with the official Oculus link cable and--...Oh, wait, Link cable didn't come with a USB-A adaptor and even my six month old PC doesn't have a spot for USB-C yet...Gotta go buy one of those first. Better spend a few extra dollars on a USB SS 10 adaptor for maximum compatibility. Though I doubt the Quest 2 requires even half as much speed, I'm not taking any chances after coming this far!10) After getting a compatible USB-A adaptor, and having three separate devices connected to the internet and logged into Facebook at the same time, I can finally play some Steamvr games.Finally....Plays perfectly and the headset is super light. The wireless mode is actually not that bad either. Some people won't like the resolution and frame rate drops in wireless but it works well enough for me. I was wondering why there were separate marketed products for things like head straps and such. It turns out it's because the built in speakers are kind of...not that great (at least they are angled in the proper direction I guess), and the head strap is not that comfortable comfortable.Compared to the original Rift I had....the Quest 2 has worse sound quality based on the placement of the speakers along. It gets foggy faster. Also, the head strap is less comfortable. Adjusting the lenses is also annoying because you have to take the headset off. On the old Rift, there was a mechanical switch on the bottom you moved so you can adjust your view with it on, which is superior to having to take the headset off several times.The balance of the controllers is also weirdly off. On the old rift, the controller ring was directly in front. combined with the weight of the controller the center of mass is directly in the center of your hand. With the new controller, it is oddly top heavy with the center of mass around your index finger and thumb. Even though it is a lighter controller, this makes it feel worse.I'm starting to wonder why I bought this thing? It's not really superior to my old headset in any way other than a modest increase in resolution and can potentially have a higher frame rate. It has arguably worse sound, and it requires me to be logged into to two additional devices so Facebook can track my data for sale like any good/evil multi-billion dollar mega corporation.Would be a four star product because it's not bad for the price but you can use it by itself. I have to take off a star because of having to be logged into Facebook on three separate devices. I have to take a star off for the annoying set up process. I also have to take a star off for the fact that I have to marry myself to Facebook in order to use it, and doing that with their privacy practices and the fact that their company exists solely to collect and sell my data...no thanks.So...yeah. 1/5 stars."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I paid for a new Quest 2 and they sent me a used one,I thought it was odd that when I first turned it on it didn't ask me to pair my headset. When I logged onto wifi there was another persons profile and I could se all of his friends activities and the apps he uploaded. Not only does this suck for me it's a HUGE privacy issues for the person who previously owned this headset. Returning for a refund and will not be purchasing again.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Great while it works, customer service could use improvements.","Perhaps I'm just extremely unlucky, but I got my Quest 2 in mid January and it's now late march and I've had two of them die on me. First after a month, second one after only a week.I will admit the device is great when it works.  Beat Saber was by far my favorite game to play with the headset. Got it set up working pretty well with my PC, played through Half Life Alyx and several other games. This would be an absolutely glowing review if not for the issues I've had with it.The first time the headset died it started making some odd hissing noises after about an hour of use. Was able to play it a few times like this before the system simply stopped responding altogether.The first time I had to contact their customer service. It took them nearly a week to get back to me. The initial customer service agent I was dealing with either wasn't reading, or not understanding my e-mails. Requesting a video of the headset literally doing nothing, and apologizing for the issues with the 'elite headstrap' rather then the headset. It took an additional week before getting passed up the chain to someone who offered to replace the headset. At which point I'd already contacted Amazon who made an exception to their returns policy due to the difficulty I was having with Oculus's customer service. So while I appreciated the effort the headset was already on it's way back to Amazon.Second headset came in. I'm usually pretty careful with my devices but I absolutely babied the thing. A week later it dies anyways. No hissing this time thankfully. But it will only display a black screen now before drifting back into sleep mode. I've tried every fix I can find online, nothing helps. Even a factory reset does nothing.I'm back in touch with Oculus support now, thankfully I seem to have skipped the low level customer service agent this time. Perhaps there was just a bad batch? Maybe I'm just that unlucky? But as of now my opinion of the Quest 2 and it's build quality is pretty low.Hopefully the third headset can last longer then a month, because as I said. When it works, it's great.Update: It took Oculus about 4 weeks to finally get me a new headset. I wouldn't be as annoyed by that if it hadn't been the second time it had died on me, or if the second one had lasted longer then a week. I also wish they would have given me some idea as to what's gone wrong, instead I'm just left deeply in doubt as to the built quality of the device.With all the positive reviews here, perhaps I've just been very unlucky. But I have a hard time recommending this device at this point. If in a few months it's still working I'll try to come back and update this review."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,BEWARE FAKE STORAGE SIZE! MODDED TO LIE ABOUT CAPACITY,BEWARE! I purchased a 256g model and what i received was one which was modded somehow to lie about its storage size much like the SD cards that where going around a while back.It said 11g out of 256 used with 80% of the bar filled and not being able to download anything more.After having a terrifying incident where my tracking completely stopped working for no damn reason i was forced to factory reset as a final hail mary chance at saving it to which i was blessed with success though it now clearly shows the correct storage size of 64g!I double checked my order and the listing and there was no mistake on that part. It clearly said 256g and i clearly paid $100+ more for it.😠😞So please be careful and reset your device IMMEDIATELY as this is the optimal time as so to not cost time or lose data and you will see the truth of your device and its capacity.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Constant WiFi issues.,"Super disappointed.  Hours of effort for a couple minutes of entertainment.  EXTREME difficulties connecting to WiFi and once it does connect, it is fleeting, there and gone minutes later.  This is after five attempts.  Turned off everything so it is the only device on WiFi, my router works fine with every other device.  There are other issues as well, options for adjusting focus are seriously limited, to the point of absurdity.  The menus are labrynthian and not at all intuitive.  Also, it won't work without your phone on and connected to the goggles and you have to connect your Facebook account so they can harvest your data.  That alone wasn't a deal breaker but it just WILL NOT hold a connection to the WiFi.  If I could just get it to connect to WiFi, I could overlook some of the other shortcomings.  I will hold out for a product which works."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Useless - Wish I would have read reviews more closely.,"If you buy this headset, you don't own it...Facebook owns you.If you buy a game console and a game, you own the game console and the license to play the game.With the Foculus after spending $300 you get the ""privilege"" of Facebook maybe allowing you to use the headset--provided you abide by their rules.- Setup a Facebook account - don't have or want a Facebook account, don't buy this headset- Abide by Facebook community standards - If your Facebook account gets suspended or blocked, you don't get to use your Foculus (it's like being punished by your parents and they take your games away)- Don't get hacked - If your Facebook account gets hacked and blocked, you don't get to use your Foculus until you get that resolved.Bottom line:If you want a VR headset that you can purchase and use, don't buy the Oculus.

Apparently it’s a known phenomenon that no one is emphasizing. Be carful. Stay away."

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It did not work out of the box.,The Oculus Quest 2 I received did not work. I followed the instructions made sure it was charged downloaded the app.... and the only thing I could see through the lenses was the Oculus Logo.After searching It turns out thats its boot screen. The Oculus wouldn't boot up. This was brand new I hope? Who knows on Amazon anymore.I'm returning it tomorrow. I only got this stupid thing because my mother wants to try it.Wtf?
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Made me sick,"I know that VR can cause illness such as dizziness/nausea, but it is HORRIBLE. I used it about three times and thought I was gradually working up to it, but I had such a dizzy episode that I literally threw up. The dizziness lasted for more than a week, although it wasn't as bad as initial episode that hit me in the middle of the night. My doctor advised that it can mess with your inner ear and brain to certain extent, but no real concern. I am not a gamer or have a NEED to use that thing, so I returned it. Was not for me."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Don’t buy if you plan to share,Don’t buy this if you play to share it with multiple users. The system only allows for one person to log in. All game progress and saved data will be for only one user. It makes sharing the system impossible.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Not happy,"The controller stopped working within a month of having it. Changed the batteries (you have to use high powered kind and I was) and did every recommended technical fix. I reached out to the company and told them I had done it all but I’m was pretty sure it was a faulty controller. They took two weeks to reply to my email, asking if I had tired techniques I already stated in my first email I had tried. Still not resolved. I wouldn’t recommend buying one."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Too many bugs to recommend right now,The headset works ok but it is super glitchy if you try to use link to play games on steam (which is why 99.7% of people bought it). Their support team has been fairly responsive but have not offered any useful fixes for the issues. Giving them 2 more days then I'll return it and wait until VR is actually ready.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Porch Pirates,"Was a victim of the porch pirates unfortunately, I know its not Amazons fault they don't deserve the one star, but still sad we live in a society for people to even do that, just trying to surprise my family for game night on the weekends guess not. Hope u has it now, it was worth putting the negative karma on your self. Even asked my neighbors if they could check there ring camera but they took it down 3 days ago cause they are moving.Update: Its now Wednesday, I've tried making a report about it but since I made the report Tuesday and it happened Sunday the police couldn't do anything. Amazon wont issue me a refund or replacment unless a police report, how am I going to do that if they can't do anything. just bought  an other. 650$ for 1 VR What Deal I Got. Seriously this sucks"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Melted charging port. Glad my house didn't burn down.,"This product is not eligible to be returned after 30 days. About 60 days after I bought it stopped charging, got very hot, smelled like a burning battery, and the charging port melted a bit. I did an Internet search and this is a problem that other Oculus 2 users are having. I reported the problem and opened a ticket on 5/26/2021. They asked some questions and so far I haven't heard back from them. There is no phone support at Oculus and the chat service can't give me an update. If they have doubts they should at least send me a label so I can send it in to be looked at/serviced/ and maybe even replaced. If you have to buy this product purchase a protection plan."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Amazon resold me a used dirty broken headset,"The device itself is awesome, unfortunately Amazon with their unethical practices sold me a used and broken device... Amazon, if you're going to sell used devices at least give me a discount 🖕🏿 the headset could not be charged, the headset was clearly dirty and used.. somebody named Frankie was the account holder, Amazon didn't even reset the headset.  just freaking lazy,  I had to return it and buy another one. The headset could not hold a charge. Left it plugged in all night and it only charged 9% 😭😭.. but when it did work for the short time it was awesome I ordered another one, I crossed my fingers and hold my breath, I hope this one is a properly functioning unit."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Horrible customer service,"The product is overall awesome. But if anything goes wrong you're on your own, the customer service is nonexistent. And you are stuck to talking to bots. Since it connects to your Facebook account.

First one, green led in left eye on always. Second one, would not boot into os fully locked in guardian mode. Third one, right eye blurry unable to fix. Fourth one, worked ok but fan noise till one week past return date on amazon and left eye bunch of yellow leds on full time.  So Pissed off I destroyed it on the floor and vowed never to buy it again or anything made from Facebook or Oculus again.  I'm buying open source VR units only from now on. You know you hate it when you can't stop smashing it every time you walk it."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Do not buy,If you play DCS don't buy. If you play in multiplayer it does not work.

Beautiful graphics.However, I do not recommend from the seller I bought from.The headset arrived incomplete. It did not include the foam interface piece.  After arrival, I ordered this piece from another seller and attached to the headset so I was able to use it. Very disappointed in the having to wait to play.Paying 399.00 + tax, I fully expected it to arrive intact.As far as the headset, I highly recommend it!! Just buyer beware of this seller."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,aboslute trash,basically buying an apple product with the boring app store of a switch. to use steam you need to install 3 different softwares NOT including steam vr and even if you figure it out you need to buy a 3rd party application that costs money you already wasted on this product. to use steam vr! and you need a strong 5ghz connection for it to be even viable in the first place and if you want to stream with a cable it's 20-40 dollars! the 3rd party app should come default with the headset in the first place. i would give this 0 stars if i could
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Requires Facebook account. Ridiculous!,An insane waste of money. Never buy a product from Facebook. What a joke. Only works if you have a Facebook account. Facebook requires a passport photo for ID. Yea...right! Absolutely ridiculous.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Controller failed within 1 month, waiting for a replacement for 3 weeks.",Our right controller failed within the first month.  We have been in contact with their support team for over 3 weeks and have not yet received a replacement.  I don't think the company can keep up with the support demand right now.  Was fun when it worked.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"VR is amazing, bodies physical response is not.","Haven't tried VR since CV1 and wanted to see the state of things. Very impressed with inside out tracking. The picture is extremely clear. But unfortunately Im still getting terrible eye and neck strain, and headaches within 20 minutes. I suspect I could get used to it and push my playtime further but the symptoms indicate to me that it's not something I should try to push. Terribly unfortunate because it really looks great and tracking is amazing. The guardian boundaries are really cool. But I just can't deal with the pain and will need to return."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Useless unless you have no family.,"Worst product I've purchased in my 17 years as a parent. I spent $900 on three of these so that my kids and I could play together. It works great, except you have to purchase every game separately for each headset. So no  playing games together unless I've spent the money three times - and most of the decent games are $20-30, so its another hundred every time. Not okay."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,utterly disapointed,"I can't give words to how little I like this device. This was my third VR device and it's equally priced with my best, yet performs worse than my worst.  I'm just sad, I hyped this thing so much before it's release and now 2 months later... Well Good luck if you decide to buy one."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,After 33 days it decides to break.,After 33 days of enjoyment the right controller simply no longer tracks changing batteries does nothing and th 2 hours i waisted with FB customer support resulted in a we will replace the controller when we can which according to FB representative will be up to 180 day. So im stuck with a $450 paper weight becuase crappy customer service and oh of course seller off the hook because 33 days is just 3 days to many to return it.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Stopped working after one month and a half,"The left controller has stopped tracking properly after a month and a half. Spoke with Amazon and they required me to go through Facebook (Facebook owns Oculus) for warranty coverage. Part of the process of determining the problem required me to make a video of the problem occurring. Luckily I had a Chromecast where I could cast the VR image to a TV to film the video. Otherwise I am not sure how I'd produce a video for Facebook. The video seemed sufficient to start a warranty process, but now I am waiting to see if a replacement will be shipped to me. When the product worked it was great, but the technical support is a lot of waiting to hear back via email."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Not so great,"It is pretty cool but it hurts our eyes.  It is also very heavy you have to keep adjusting it.  My son was very upset because it wouldn't turn on after trying to charge it. But it was pretty cool.  Also when it came down to getting a refund after they received the item I kept getting the runaround.  I would not recommend buying something like this from here.  Also, I had to bring my son to the doctor cause he kept crying about his eyes as well.  My eyes have been hurting from this item as well."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Headset doesn't work - Customer Support Incompetent and unhelpful - do not buy,"The headset is having an issue with randomly disconnecting from the PC, many users are also reporting the same problem, but Oculus hasn't come out with a response for it and after four actual months of customer service (email only by the way, it takes days in between each message), they sent me a replacement only for me to still be experiencing the same issue. They now refuse to refund the new one.Not everyone is experiencing the same issues, but keep in mind that if anything goes wrong, you're on your own and likely already past their 30 day return policy. Probably better to just spend more money on something more proven.  This headset is not cheap and now it's a waste of money."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,doesn't work,this came with no instruction as how to operate it.  So far about 5 hours wasted.needs to come with instructionsday 2 and so far it is worthless with no phone number to call for assistanceI am 71ordered a book off amazon by a private party on how to make it work.  I will wait to receive the book before i return the oculus 2.frustrating!
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook just bricked this product by not allowing us to create an account,"My son was so excited to spend his saved up chore money to buy this. Then he tried to create a Facebook account. He's 13 and has an email account he's been using for years, he meets their criteria. Facebook immediately said that he violated community standards and disabled him. From what I'm seeing when I google it could take months to get them to review it. In the meantime this thing is useless and there's no way of knowing if they'll ever let him use it. Garbage."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Caution: bad skin reaction from mask,My sons face blistered and oozed and was so swollen for wearing the face mask. Whatever chemicals are in the foam that surrounds the face mask caused this horrific and costly (visit to pediatrician and meds) experience.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"DONT BUY, LENSES ARE BLURRY AND DEFECTIVE","This is my first experience with VR and I thought that lenses were maybe supposed to be blurry but I have now found out that no other headset has this issue. The lenses on the Oculus Quest 2 are very blurry around the edges and the refresh rate is extremely low which causes a lot of strain on your eyes and a very pixelated image. I tried adjusting the headset every way possible, I searched reddit for similar experiences and there are thousands of other people who have the exact same issue. Oculus created a defective product which is probably why it is so cheap. Once you buy an Occulus Quest 2 you also need to make a Facebook account which I didn't have an issue with and then you have to purchase games via the store which are usually around 30-40 dollars per game. I cannot in good faith recommend this product to anyone and I'm disgusted by all of the famous YouTube reviewers claiming it to be the best wireless headset and comparable to the index. DO NOT BUY THIS. IT IS A SCAM."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Blurry Despite Tweaks and IPD Adjustments,"Blurry and irritatingly small sweet spot. I have spent several hours researching and trying fixes and tweaks for only marginal improvement. Adjustments including adjusting the texture size and such via Sidequest and adjusting the straps and tilt. My IPD lines up well with setting 2. I have 20/20 vision, so no glasses. Getting a replacement but will return if problems persist. Ridiculous amount of tweaking to get only a small improvement. I hope the replacement HMD works better otherwise I’ll shell out for an HP Reverb G2 or something."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE NO HELP- DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,The picture says it all .The  piece snapped off rendering the head strap completely useless. I’ve contacted oculus several times I received no help it is now six months since I bought it and it’s been broken for 2 months. nobody will help me replace the piece even though there is a known defect.Amazon  was no help in opening a case .
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,FANTASTIC! While it lasts.,"Works great, has that annoying facebook nonsense everyone else is complaining about, but it can really be taken and used just about anywhere.Unfortunately, my left controller started to become twitchy and unresponsive after I'd had the set for about four days. Yeah, no, I'm gonna pass on any replacement pieces. This is cheaper than other sets for a reason."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Defected and obviously not a new product, very sad.","The product is registered already by someone else, I can even watch Netflix with his ID. They sold just USED one as a new product. Really astonishing!! Are they a legit seller?Right thumb sensor not work well at arrival. The package was not sealed (it should be like the picture). Most of all it smells men's skin in foam and strings. It is not even repackaged in right way. Eyeglass covers are attached on controller, crumbled inside. Very disappointed. You need to send me sealed product or at least properly working product."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Waste of money,Very limited games without a link cable. Even using a link cable its so buggy slightly moving the cable connected to your pc instantly disconnects the link and closes the game its unplayable.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,broke and all they did was told me to do a factory reset,"This was awesome at first, my boyfriend played a boxing game on this for maybe 3 months… After that, the screen was severely water damaged. We contacted customer service to honor the warranty, and we were asked to factory reset the device which obviously had nothing to do with the damaged screen and would not work. What an expensive purchase to have fail, with basically no support from customer service"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Worthless,"Poor lens quality, halo effect is high. IPD settings does not change this. Facebook account requirement is an extreme annoyance but not a deal breaker. Battery life is non-existent. Weight is over-bearing. Strap design by default is uncomfortable.This is a cheap VR headset that barely bridges the door of the experience. Spend the extra money and get something worthy of your hard-earned dollar."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Need a fb accountant,You need a Facebook account to use this thing. Beyond stupid. Returned it
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Faulty and Amazon won’t even let me return it!!,"Was great for a couple of months, now the screen randomly blinks once or twice an hour, some times more often than others. Oculus haven’t been helpful at all, so I tried to return it to Amazon as it’s faulty and Amazon won’t even let me return it. Amazon has changed, used to have such great service but asn an international customer I don’t think I’ll buy from Amazon, or Oculus in the future"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Awful.  Regret this purchase,"Absolutely awful system.  Battery life is bad.  Trying to connect a regular Steam game is hell.  Constant patches needed, constant glitches.  This is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Controller stopped working after one use.,"Purchased for a birthday present. As I was testing it before I handed over to the birthday boy, the right controller stopped working. After following directions from Oculus to pair again, the whole unit crapped out. Extremely disappointing. I have had many Oculus products with no issues. Need to be better in quality control. Now I have to get a new one rushed before the party tomorrow. This might be my last Oculus. Not worth the aggravation."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Facebook wants to run your life.,Facebook is mandatory to use this. Should've read the reviews. Returned the item.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Trash,"Quest 2 is trash.  Forced to create Facebook account which lowers quality of life dealing with all the impulsive behaviors Social media bring forth..  mainly used for PC link to play PC games. after about two months of ownership an update destroyed that. after update constant white line on bottom of screen with pixel distortion..  near constant crashing even tho when tested it says my PC and everything is up to the task.  needless to say, just deleted Facebook account the threw the Quest 2 in the trash..  i will be buying a VR that is Geared for VR and not for Social media and Advertising."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Hope you don’t wear glasses!,"Some genius decided to make the headset smaller, more narrow Soooooo if you wear glasses you are basically kicked out of the oculus market.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"How frustrating it was to configure everything and suddenly, the product stopped working completely!","After a few interactions with the product, it stopped working completely overnight. I have already followed all the trobleshooting instructions and I have a support ticket (Oculus 27907##) but no one has answered. How frustrating was this experience with a facebook product. To make things even worse, amazon does not refund the total value of the return shipment (international)."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Not worth our time,"The Occulus wouldn't download anything. We thought it was our wifi but after calling them out and checking,  it was fine and working fine for out other devices.  We sent it back"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I Bought A Brick,"I have the original Rift and TL;DR from what I can tell this is headset is far superior. That said I bought a $450 brick because of the Facebook account requirement. Any account lock bricks the Oculus which is the greediest thing I've ever seen. Hopefully a lawsuit for monopolistic practices forces the decoupling of this Facebook requirement. Love Oculus, Facebook can eat it."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Forget it if you wear glasses all the time.,"bought it and installed glasses spacer which was in box, after 20 min setting up VR set and buying apps and games (HUUUUGE MISTAKE, make sure you want/like this headset  before you buy apps) realized slightly blurred vision and blamed it on eyelashes swinging too close to my glasses from inside, apparently i got my glasses scratched somehow in it."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Very glitchy! Quest 1 is better,Just got it and it's already giving problems by not detecting the controller. Never had any issues with my quest 1. This has improved graphics and resolution but way too many problems. No wonder it's cheaper. If you have the quest 1 don't upgrade to the quest 2 it's not worth it.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,I thought we were buying new and it was a used product.,"This Oculus was purchased as a birthday gift and given over the past weekend. When the Oculus was taken out of the shipping box, the outer box had return labels on it, this should have been our first clue, but we thought maybe someone bought it and returned it unused. However, when the person we gave the gift to opened it and started to use his Oculus, it said, ""Welcome (a previous owner's name)."" Proving to us that this product had been used before. The other disappointing factor is the thumb does not show up when using the product. I would suggest making sure your product is truly new like you are paying for before giving it as a gift."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Screen tear in right lense came ruined.,Was so good to get this turned on in the right lower lense there's what seems like a cut in paper with white light coming through. Seems to be the lens maybe because it follows on the screen wherever I look. Terrible ruins the ability to play without the very noticeable screen light tear!
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Think after $500 they could give you one game.. nope!,"Wasted $500 on this. Have two girls 9 and 4.  Turned around and bought $120 worth of games (since it doesn’t come with any only, 3 games).  10minutes later. I’m bored!!!!"
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,My unit had God Rays and blurriness problems,"I own the original Rift and Rift S and compared to them the Quest 2 I received is unusable. I think I may have got a bad unit because even when I find the very small sweet spot a strange transparent circular black outline is always visible, God rays are significantly worse than on the Rift and Rift S, and besides in maybe the middle 20% of the screen everything is very blurry. I've used many headsets and understand that all these issues do happen it's just in this case they all happen to such a degree that just a few seconds in the headset has me nauseous. I've had good luck with Oculus products in the past so I'll probably wait and see if quality control improves in a few months and buy a new unit/update my review then."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,FB BS,I've bought it for its highly reviews but didn't actually know that every step i do has to do with my FB accountAlso if your FB account deleted you'll lose your device as well

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,It was fully functional for about 10 weeks,"It worked great and I loved it, until one of the controllers stopped working after 10 weeks.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Terrible customer service,Tried to link Oculus and Facebook account.  Something is not right and we can no longer log in and use this.  No number to call Oculus so we emailed them.  Got an email that they would get in contact with us in 2 to 3 business day.  Haven't heard from them.  Have been able to use this device a handful of days out of the 3 weeks we have owned it.  Terrible customer service.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,"Had it two months, controller stopped working","Loved it at first, then after about two months one of the controllers stopped working.

1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Defective AGAIN!,It's been stuck in USB Update mode for over a week.  This is a replacement for one that had defective lenses.I paid the extra $100 for my daughter's and she's had no problems.  Coincidence?  I  think not.  It appears that they will send you a low-quality product unless you buy the more expensive one!Sucks!
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Doesn't work.  No phone support.,The included instructions are worthless and the website is no better.  This is a complex product requiring phone support.  The lack of phone support is what got me to return the product.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Horrible company,The worst customer service ever! I REGRET buying this. My son had a severe reaction to the foam and I have been dealing with this company since I bought it. I want all my money back. I think it is worth to sue because it was a lot of money.
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Bricked after less than a week due to incompetent design,"Oculus requires an facebook account to use. There is absolutely no way around this. I attempted to work around this restriction by using a temporary email to make a throw-away account. Less than a week later, facebook auto-deleted the account for inactivity. after a couple highly frustrating hours talking to facebook support, they refused to reinstate the account without me having access to the email. The only option I was given was to reset the device to factory settings and start over with a new facebook. Leaving me with an expensive device that I cant use due to my respect for my own privacy."
1.0,Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 64 GB,Not good and slightly malicioius,"Purchased this product to use with my computer, little did I know the cable that comes with it is not the correct cable to use.
